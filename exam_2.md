## Chapter 7: Business Markets and Buying Behavior

### Categories of Business Markets

There are four major categories in the business market:

#### Commercial

This is the largest segment of the business market. This is the market for individuals and organizations that need materials to create other products, from computer chips to bulk chocolate chips, electricity to mops. This includes farmers, manufacturers, contractors, utilities.  
 
#### Reseller

From Office Depot to Home Depot, these are businesses that purchase finsihed products and resell them to the consumer. Sometimes they may further process the product before selling, Like purchasing bulk woodchips, and selling them in 50 pound sacks, or cutting a side of beef into parts.  

#### Government

Federal, state, local, and foreign governments purchase a wide range of goods and services. Typically these are to provide some form of public benefit.  

#### Institutional

This includes hospitals, churches, colleges, museums, non-profits. Some have standardized purchasing procedures, others less so.  

## Chapter 8: Global Marketing

### Strategies for Entering Foreign Markets

Entering foreign markets offers more than just an opportunity for increased revenue. It also offers insights in to new ways to do business, new ideas for products, and marketing ideas that they may be able to leverage in their domestic market as well. Generally speaking, the more control an organization maintains, the higher the risk.  
There are six strategies for entering foreign markets. Organizations can use more than one at the same time:  
* Exporting
* Franchising
* Foreign Licensing
* Subcontracting
* International divisions
* Acquisitions
* Join ventures

#### Exporting

Exporting allows producers to sell in foreign markets without commiting to formal operations.  
Export trading companies (ETCs) buy products domestically to resell in foreign markets. Producers lose control over the marketing and distribution, but it is a low cost, low risk channel, and provides some feedback regarding their potential marketability abroad. 
Export-management companies (EMCs) provide expert services to connect exporters with foreign buyers, and navigate legal and regulatory barriers. This option provides the producer with a little more control over the process.  

#### Franchising and Foreign Licensing

A **franchise** is a contractual agreement between a franchiser and a franchisee. The franchiser provides the franchisee the right to use their name, sell their products, and also provides marketing, management, and other services. The franchisee agrees to follow the franchisers operating requirements. Franchising typically reduces risks for the franchisee by offering a proven concept, brand recognition, increased operating efficiencies, and reduced costs.  
**Foreign licensing** grants rights to a foreign marketer within a geographical region. The foreign marketer may have access to trademarks, use of patents and patented processes, as well as distribution and marketing rights. These agreements usually exist for a predetermined period of time, before they are renegotiated.  
Franchising and licensing have more risk than exporting, but allow greater control over the marketing and distribution while allowing access to local partners with expertise in distribution channels and legal barriers. The initial cost is limited, making it an appealing option for companies of all sizes.  

#### Subcontracting

Subcontracting the production of goods can help avoid cultural challenges, and protect against import tariffs. It can also reduce manufacturing costs.  
On the down side, it may also result in associating the brand with harsh working conditions, or produce inferior products.  

### International Direct investment

#### International Divisions

Larger companies with the resources can establish facilities in their target region and maintain complete control over the operations.  

#### Acquisitions

Another way to enter a foreign market is to purchase an established business there.  

#### Joint Ventures

Joint ventures allow an organization to establish local partnerships and share costs, risks, and management of the operations there.  

## Chapter 9: Market Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning

### Criteria for Effective Market Segmentation

Effective marketing needs to identify the correct segment of the market that is most likely to purchase their products. **Market segmentation** is the dividing of a market into smaller, somewhat homogeneous groups. Determining useful ways to segment a market helps marketers succeed in communicating with the right consumers. A viable market segment needs to meet three criteria:
* Significant in size and purchasing power
* Profitable
* Consistent with the firm's marketing capabilities

#### Significant in Size and Purchasing Power

Is the segment large enough and have the purching power (authority and discretionary income) to warrant targeting them?  

#### Profitable

Is enough of the segment able to afford the product? Especially if selling a high end product, the market segment needs to have the wealth to purchase it, as opposed to a less expensive similar item (Example, Mercedes vs. Ford).  

#### Consistent with the Firm's Marketing Capabilities

To be a viable market segment, the organization needs to be able to market to them. This could require adjusting their branding, modifying their product, or other changes that the organization would have to be comfortable doing.  

Market segmentation is about identifying a set of traits that seperates a sub-group within a market from the rest of the market. Understanding this groups characteristics is essential to develop a successful, targeted marketing strategy. Characteristics include buying patterns, income, location, age and gender.

## Chapter 10: Market Research

### Secondary Data Collection

Secondary data is data from previously published sources. It is typically avaliable at low to no cost. There are four main sources for secondary data:  

* Internal Data
* Government Data
* Industry Publications
* Research Services

#### Internal Data

Companies have lots of useful data. Sales analysis is a great source of information. Accounting statements, web analytics, product reviews, are all examples of internal data. But internal data can be limiting. To answer research questions external sources of data are usually needed.  

#### Government Data

The U.S. government collects data on housing, population, businesses, manufacturing, agriculture, minerals, and governments, through the United [States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/). This is the most commonly referenced government data source.  

#### Industry Publications

Trade associations, business and trade magazines, provide valuable information at significantly less than a research study. [Gale's Encyclopedia of Associations](https://www.gale.com/) can help marketers locate relevent organizations and publications.  

#### Research Services

Several research firms offer business information for a fee. GfK Roper Reports Worldwide has consumer information from 30 countries. Wright Investors create research reports on 31,000 companies in 60 countries. And Nielsen provides an array of valuable services.  

### Primary Research Methods

Primary data is information collected for the first time, specifically to support marketing research. There are several methods, and marketers may combine more than one to achieve their goals.  

#### Observation

Observation can be controlled or free form. Tracking consumer footsteps in supermarkets to look for behavior patterns, or counting the numbre of cars that pass a store front, can provide useful data for marketers. Also, getting consumer consent to file the way they use a product, or operate in a specific environment where a product might be, or providing children with toys and watching how they play, can provide useful primary data for marketing decisions.  
**Interpretive research** involves observing consumers in their natural environment and interpreting the observations through a social lense, studying the culture in which they live. This can sometimes be called an _ethnographic study_, when the researcher are trying to understand behaviors based on ethno-cultural influences.  

#### Survey

Surveys involve asking consumers questions and gathering their attitudes, motives, opinions, etc. There are several ways to do this:  
_Telephone interviews_ are quick and low cost. Simply worded questions should be used.  
_Personal interviews_ allows the marketer to establish a repport with the consumer, and to clarify any misunderstandings of the questions asked. This could be in an office, home, or public space.  
_Focus Groups_ bring small groups together to discuss a subject.They encourage general discussion on the topic. These are great for developing new product ideas and trying out new marketing strategies.  
_Online or mail surveys_ are efficient and cost-effective. Anonymity might influence the honesty of the responses.  
Online services like Survey Monkey have made survey based research readily available for organizations of all sizes.  

#### Test Marketing

Introducing new products in select geographical locations to see how it performs is expensive, but allows companies to try out a new product for less than going live in all markets. And it allows marketers to play with the marketing mix on a small scale first. It does have the downside of revealing upcoming products to competitors before expanding to more markets.

Example: Netflix wants to know if users will pay extra for pay-per-view sporting events. Secondary data on purchase rates for this kind of event could be found in industry reports. Primary data could be collected by interviewing current subscribers.  

## Chapter 11: Product and Branding Concepts

### What Are Goods and Services?

Products are goods and services. **Goods** are _tangible_, like a car, a hamburger, or a screwdriver. **Services** are _intangible_, like a concert, a manicure, or surgery.  
How to tell a service from a good:  

1. _Services are intangible:_ There is no physical product.  
2. _Services are insperable from the service providers:_ Lawn care, dentistal care, legal advice, are all provided by a person or organization.  
3. _Services are perishable:_ There is no inventory. Prices may change depending on demand (seasonal or otherwise).  
4. _Companies cannot easily standardize services:_ While many service providers attempt to create a consistant experience across many locations (hotels, fast food restaurants), typically every experience is to some extent tailored to the individual (physical therapy, haircut, massage).  

### Goods' Services Continuum

The Goods' Services Continuum divides goods and services into three categories:  

* Pure good: A car, a television
* Mixture of good and service: A good meal at a restaurant.
* Pure service: A golf lesson, financial advice.

### Types of Business Products

The classification of business purchases is based on use, not consumer behavior. There are six basic categories.  
* Installations
* Accessory equiptment
* Component parts and materials
* Raw materials
* Supplies
* Business services

#### Installations

These are major capital investments, typically involving numerous decision makers over the course of many months. Price is typically not a major factor. Installations include heavy machinery, customized software, telcom systems, factories.  

#### Accessory Equipment

These are more frequent purchases, and price is a larger factor in the decision. Accessory equipment includes items like cellphones, laptops, furniture.  

#### Component Parts and Materials

These are finished parts from one manufacturer that become part of the product the purchsing business manufactures. These purchases are generally contracted. Computer chips, buttons and switches, power supplies are examples of component parts and materials.  

#### Raw Materials

These are typically natural resources that will require some processing to integrate into the businesses products. These could be metals, grain, wood.  

#### Supplies

Supplies are what a business uses in the course of daily operations. These are routine purchases. Paper, pens, staples, are examples of supplies.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Business Services

Services are intangible proudcts purchsed to facilitate their productions and operations.  Electricity and internet access are examples of business services.  

## Chapter 12: Developing and Managing Products

### The Product Lifecycle

The **product lifecycle** refers to the progression of a product or product category through four basic stages within its industry.  

#### Introductory Stage

This is the new-market entry for a product or product category. Consumers start to become acquainted. Profits are low, and costs can be substantial as the product is adapted to the market response, or technological advances.  

#### Growth Stage

Industry profits peak as more consumers purchase the product and early purchasers return to buy again. Profitability pulls new entrants into the market, which can ultimately lead to a decline in industry profits as competition forces lower pricing.  

#### Maturity Stage

Sales continue to grow durring the early part of this phase, but then plateau. Profits continue to decline due to the number of competitors in the market.  

#### Decline Stage

Shifts in consumer preferences continue the decline in sales and profitablilty. New technology creates new products that replace the old ones.
