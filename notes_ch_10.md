### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Netflix has changed the way companies produce content, and the way consumers consume it. Leveraging the likes and dislikes they've accumulated over the years, they are able to predict what consumers will want to see and acquire or create it. Consumers watch more movies online now than on Blu-Ray or DVD.  

## 10.1 The Marketing Research Process
"Describe the six steps in the marketing research process."  

### Opening Example
After nearly going bankrupt, Lego undertook a four year marketing research plan, to guide what kind of construction kits to produce.  

### 10.1a Learning It: The Marketing Research Process
**Marketing research** is the collection and use of information in decision making. It comes from sources like:  
* Well-planned studies designed to elicit specific information
* Salesforce reports, accounting records,and published reports
* Controlled experiments and computer simulations

Having the information they need at the right time helps marketers make better decisions. Marketing research follows a six-step process:
1. Define the Problem
1. Conduct Exploratory Reseach
1. Formulate a Hypothesis
1. Create a Research Design
1. Collect Data
1. Interpret and Present Research Data

<div class="pagebreak">

#### Define the Problem
For researchers to find the correct information, the problem to solve must be clearly defined. Questions could be, "Who buys our product?" or "Why doesn't [insert consumer segment here] buy our product?" or "Why isn't our current marketing strategy generating the desired results?"  

#### Conduct Exploratory Reseach
With the problem clearly defined, researchers can speak with informed sources in, and out-side of the company. This might include customers, retailers, product owners, and accessing company data, like sales and profit analysis and comnpetitive data.  

#### Formulate a Hypothesis
The next step is to draw upon what they've learned to come up with a hypothesis that they can test. Not all studies do this, but it can be extremely beneficial to the outcome of the research to have this additional focus.  

#### Create a Research Design
Designing a research plan involves identifying what types of research will be performed, and what it will measure. This should be designed to yeild the most accurate information possible.  

#### Collect Data
Data falls into two categories, primary and secondary. Primary data is data collected by the research process, and is specifically to address the defined problem. Secondary data is data collected from existing sources. This can include data from public studies, government census data, internal data. Secondary data is easy to gather, but may not relate specifically enough to the defined problem. Primary data can take much longer to gather, but should relate more directly to the problem.  

#### Interpret and Present Research Data
Finally, researchers must interpret their results and present it in written and oral form, in a manor that allows decision makers to use it effectively.  

It is possible for this process to be cyclical, as decision makers implement changes and find new problems.  

### 10.1b Closing Example
Lego focused particularly on why girls only made up 10% of their users. Using direct observation, they identified differences in the way girls play with Legos, and adpted their product line to include kits they believed would be more attractive to girls. They introduced "Lego Friends," which included characters with back stories, puppies, pastel blox, and kits fro beach houses, party shops, even a puppy daycare. It's now one of their top selling lines.

## 10.2 Secondary Data Collection
"Summarize the four sources of secondary marketing research data."  

### Opening Example
Scenerio: Gym owner wants to expand into two new cities, but wants to make sure the right demographics are there. What kind of secondary data might she use?  

### 10.2a Learning It: Secondary Data Collection
Secondary data is data from previously published sources. It is typically avaliable at low to no cost. There are four main sources for secondary data:  
* Internal Data
* Government Data
* Industry Publications
* Research Services

#### Internal Data
Companies have lots of useful data. Sales analysis is a great source of information. Accounting statements, web analytics, product reviews, are all examples of internal data. But internal data can be limiting. To answer research questions external sources of data are usually needed.  

#### Government Data
The U.S. government collects data on housing, population, businesses, manufacturing, agriculture, minerals, and governments, through the United [States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/). This is the most commonly referenced government data source.  

#### Industry Publications
Trade associations, business and trade magazines, provide valuable information at significantly less than a research study. [Gale's Encyclopedia of Associations](https://www.gale.com/) can help marketers locate relevent organizations and publications.  

#### Research Services
Several research firms offer business information for a fee. GfK Roper Reports Worldwide has consumer information from 30 countries. Wright Investors create research reports on 31,000 companies in 60 countries. And Nielsen provides an array of valuable services.  

### 10.2b Closing Example
Combining Census data with Nielsen's PRIZM segmentation data helped our gym owner identify the right locations for her new gyms.  

<div class="pagebreak">

## 10.3 Primary Research Methods
"Compare the three principal methods of collecting primary marketing research data."  

### Opening Example
Johnson & Johnson conducted research with over 400 mothers and young childern with sleep problems to see if they could identfy patterns that lead to better sleep. They used surveys and a daily sleep diary to gather primary data. Their data indicated that a nightly bedtime routine for babies lead to better sleep.  

### 10.3a Learning It: Primary Research Methods
Primary data is information collected for the first time, specifically to support marketing research. There are several methods, and marketers may combine more than one to achieve their goals.  

#### Observation
Observation can be controlled or free form. Tracking consumer footsteps in supermarkets to look for behavior patterns, or counting the numbre of cars that pass a store front, can provide useful data for marketers. Also, getting consumer consent to file the way they use a product, or operate in a specific environment where a product might be, or providing children with toys and watching how they play, can provide useful primary data for marketing decisions.  
**Interpretive research** involves observing consumers in their natural environment and interpreting the observations through a social lense, studying the culture in which they live. This can sometimes be called an _ethnographic study_, when the researcher are trying to understand behaviors based on ethno-cultural influences.  

#### Survey
Surveys involve asking consumers questions and gathering their attitudes, motives, opinions, etc. There are several ways to do this:  
_Telephone interviews_ are quick and low cost. Simply worded questions should be used.  
_Personal interviews_ allows the marketer to establish a repport with the consumer, and to clarify any misunderstandings of the questions asked. This could be in an office, home, or public space.  
_Focus Groups_ bring small groups together to discuss a subject.They encourage general discussion on the topic. These are great for developing new product ideas and trying out new marketing strategies.  
_Online or mail surveys_ are efficient and cost-effective. Anonymity might influence the honesty of the responses.  
Online services like Survey Monkey have made survey based research readily available for organizations of all sizes.  

#### Test Marketing
Introducing new products in select geographical locations to see how it performs is expensive, but allows companies to try out a new product for less than going live in all markets. And it allows marketers to play with the marketing mix on a small scale first. It does have the downside of revealing upcoming products to competitors before expanding to more markets.

### 10.3b Closing Example
Johnson & Johnson's research allowed them to market a night time regimine using their products, that helps babies get to sleep and sleep better.  

## 10.4 Conduction International Market Research
"Outline four considerations for conducting market research in global markets."  

### Opening Example
Companies like Frito Lay and Quaker have been very effective at conduction international market research, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. They adapted their products tastes match to the local culture's, releasing new products like Quaker Congees, using Chinese ingredients.  
Why is international market research different, and why is Quaker so good at it?  

<div class="pagebreak">

### 10.4a Learning It: Conduction International Market Research
There are four considerations when conducting market research in global markets.  

#### Access to Secondary Data
Although many countries don't collect as much or as accurate census data as the United States, there are other sources of secondary data available. The U.S. government operates a site called Export.gov (now [Trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/)) that collects research about over 130 countries, organized by country and industry. Personalized counseling is available, and personalized research is available for a fee. There is a lot of information focused on international business here. The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home) also has a website with data and research available.   

#### Language Differences
It is important to use well translated language when conducting research abroad. Poorly translated questions result in misleading data. Back translation is a practice where a document is translated in to the native language by one translator, then back to the original language by another. If the documents are significantly different, there may be a problem in the translation.  

#### Global Business Environment
Trade regulations and political/economical conditions effect a countries buiness environment. Using local researchers may accurately assess the potential for foreign investors.  

#### Data Collection Methods
Adapt data collection methods to the market. Many emerging markets might have high illiteracy rates, so survey by mail or internet would be limited and incomplete. These locations are better suited for face to face interviews.   

### 10.4b Closing Example
Quaker opened their own research and development center in China. This allowed them to tailer their products to the Chinese tastes and become the largest manufacturer of breakfast cereal in the country. Smaller companies may not be able to open their own R&D center, but they could still leverage local researcheres to eliminating language and culture errors. Local relevance is essencial to success. Using focus groups and employing experts in the local cuisine has given Quaker an edge.  

## 10.5 Technology in Marketing Research
"Summarize how technology is used to assist collection and analysis of marketing research data."  

### Opening Example
There are 4 million babies born in the U.S. every year. This makes mom's-to-be a profitable target market. In an attempt to identify and reach future mom's before the competition, Target developed a "pregnancy prediction" score around the purchasing habits of 25 products. This allowed them to be remarkably accurate in identify and soliciting mothers-to-be.  

### 10.5a Learning It: Technology in Marketing Research
Before the 1930s, marketing researchers primarily used written testimonials from their customers to develop strategy. Then statistical techniques led to refined sampling procedures and more accurate findings. Today computers have changed the way marketing research is done in three significant ways.  

#### Data Collection
The internet allows for online surveys, online focus groups, large sample sizes, no geographical boundaries, and lower costs. Technology also has new ways to observe consumer behavior. Netflix is an example of an industry leader that can gather realtime data about it's customers' behaviors.  

#### Data Reporting and Access
Research aggregators like Datamonitor and eMarketer are companies that qcuire, reformat, and resell premium ressearch reports. Companies like Datamonitor and eMarketer are able to use their databases to create specialized, detailed reports, quickly and cost-efficiently.  
**Big data** has grown from the many technological touchpoints (social media, cellphone apps, internet searches), and provides organizations of all sides to analyze large volumes and varieties of consumer data. Learning to manage and analyze big data is an important challenge for modern-day marketers.  

#### Data Analysis
Technology is required and available to process and analyze the huge volume of data available today.  
**Data mining** is the process of searching through large volumes of data looking for hard to percieve patterns that can help marketers with strategic planning.    
**Predictive analytics**is the using of marketing data to model scenarios and create forcasts. This allows marketers to focus on plans that have the greatest chance of success.  

### 10.5b Closing Example
Target realized that their predictive analysis was amazing, but that acting too agressively could actual turn customers off. By mixing in other domestic products, the took the focus away from the expected child and allowed those products to subtly be included in an otherwise benign piece of marketing.  

## 10.6 Classifying Data as Primary or Secondary
"Given a list of marketing research data from various sources, classify as either primary or secondary data."  

### Opening Example
Netflix is able to collect huge amounts of data about their customers quickly. It is extremely valuable to their marketers to understand the mindset of their customers. But it doesn't help them to understand what people who don't subscribe to Netflix are interested in. This raises the question, what shows do they watch and why don't they subscribe to Netflix?

Example: Netflix wants to know if users will pay extra for pay-per-view sporting events. Secondary data on purchase rates for this kind of event could be found in industry reports. Primary data could be collected by interviewing current subscribers.  

### 10.7 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Netflix collects market data from all of its subscribers in over 190 countries, tracking what and how they watch programs. They also develop secondary data through surveys and foucs groups. All of this data helps marketers develop their objectives and strategies.
