### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Progressive Insurance is used as an example of an organization that uses technology and marketing to diferenciate itself. Along with an iconic spokeswoman, Progressive utilizes technology and services to sell policies and resolve claims quickly and easily (think, four Ps). They also publish their rates in comparison to their competition's, and reports their financial reports monthly, rather than quarterly. They have also joined _The Ethisphere Institute's Business Ethics Leadership Allieance (BELA)_.  

## 3.1 The Marketing Environment
"Identify the five components of the marketing environment."  

### Opening Example
What ever the brand or business (pizza restaurants, for example), understanding the changing landscape of the marketing environment (technological, socio-cultural, competitive) is part of developing a successful marketing strategy.  

### 3.1a Learning It: The Marketing Environment
To make decisions about _target markets_ and the marketing mix (_Product/Pricing/Promotion/Place(AKA Distribution_)), marketers need to consider five dimensions of the marketing environment:  
* Competitive
* Political-legal
* Economic
* Technological
* Social-cultural  

These dimensions can impact and influence each-other. For example socio-cultural awareness of environmental concerns can lead to political-legal regulations and enforcement, which in turn can have an economic impact and shape competitive behaviors in the market.  

### 3.1.b Closing Example
A social-cultural trend is the demand and expectation of easy ways to order products, including pizza. Accounting for this, and noting that competitors will too, a web and/or phone app is a natural result. The easier this app makes it to order/reorder, the sooner/faster/better it will be adopted.  
In This example, changes in consumer technologies led naturally to the result.  

## 3.2 The Competitive Environment
"Contrast the two types of competition that marketers face."  

### Opening Example
McDonald's McCafe struggles to compete against Starbucks. What can marketing do to draw customers away from Starbacks and into McDonalds?  

### 3.2a Learning It: The Competitive Environment
_Direct_ competition: Live products compete for market share. Example: McDonalds and Wendys. Verizon and T-Mobile. Ford and Dodge.  
_Indirect_ competition: Substitutable products compete for market share. Example: TV Dinner vs KFC. Tea vs Coffee. Pizza vs Tacos.  
These define the **competitive environment** inwhich marketers compete for customer dollars.  

Three questions to help determine a **competitive strategy**:
1. Should we compete?
> What are the firms resources, objectives, and expected profits?
2. If so, in what markets should we compete?
> What are the resources available? how and where to allocate them for greatest effect?
3. How should we compete?
> Choose the bases to compete with (quality, price, customer service, etc.). How to shape the marketing mix accordingly?  
> 

### 3.2b Closing Example
McDonalds requires a multi-faceted strategy: Improve quality of coffee, and social-cultural credibility (sustainable crops). Improve equipment (better espresso makers) and product (add lattes, capaccinos, etc.). Use a mobile app, with loyalty rewards, to make the purchase easier/incentivised.  Add complementary products like breakfast sandwiches and croissants.  

## 3.3 The Political-Legal Environment
"Summarize the four major types of government regulations that affect marketing practices."  

### Opening Example
A monopoly is an example of a how a legal regulation that can drive the government to take action against an organization. Microsoft, for example, was accused of being a monopoly. Why, and what could they have done differently to avoid this legal quagmire?  

### 3.3a Learning It: The Political-Legal Environment
_The political-legal environment_ is the part of the environment where the government creates rules and regulations to protect consumers, and maintain competitive conditions. These can come from the federal, state, or even town or city level. These can be copyright protections (logos/color combinations), labor laws (age/safety), advertising regulations (think cigarettes on a bulletin board), among others.  

Marketers need to be aware of regulations that affect their industry.  

Four phases of government regulations:  
1. Late 1800s, early 1900s: Anti monopoly (antitrust). These laws are still relevent.  
2. 1930s (The Great Depression): regulating competition ot protect small merchants from larger ones. Probably irrelevent today, it would be a CVS vs the corner pharmacy situation.  
3. Regulating how products were made and sold to protect consumers.  
4. Deregulation of certain industries: telcoms, utilities, transport, financial services (think Regan).

### 3.3b Closing Example
Microsoft was found guilty of predatory practices. By distributing their browser with the dominant (90% market share) operating system, and by keeping secret their OS APIs, they had an unfair advantage over other browser creators trying to compete in the browser space. They were also found to have presured other tech-companies to use their browser. The government required them to share their APIs and to make their Windows OS compatible with their competitions browsers. These decisions were to insure a competitive market.  

## 3.4 Types of Regulatory Forces
"Describe the regulatory forces that influence the marketing environment."  

### Opening Example
Gerber marketed their Good Start Gentle baby formula as "reducing the risk of developing allergies" and labeled the packaging with a gold seal boasting that their product meets the FDA Qualified Health Claim. While being very convincing to parents, this claim got them into trouble.  

### 3.4a Learning It: Types of Regulatory Forces
#### Government Regulatory Agencies
FTC is the most powerful regulatory agency. It monitors and enforces violations in advertising through multiple media channels, as well as labeling. Other agencies to know about: Consumer Product Safety Commission, Federal Power Commission, EPA, FDA, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  

#### Other Regulatory Forces
There are many pubilc and private consumer interest groups, as well as many _self-regulatory organizations_. Groups like AARP and the BBB are extremely effective, despite not having government regulatory power. And let's not forget PADI (for divers), the Direct Marketing Association, the National Advertising Review Board.  

Complying with regulations and non-governmental groups is good for a companies reputation. Even better is to provide products that will meet future needs.  

3.4b Closing Example
Gerber petitioned the FDA twice to get permission to use their claim that their whey-free formula, and twice they were denied. The FDA felt there was no science to back their claim. Their advertising was false and the FDA came after them.  

## 3.5 The Economic Environment
"Outline the economic factors that affect marketing decisions and consumer buying power."  

### Opening Example
When the housing bubble burst in December of 2007, the economic impact rippled throughout the economies of the world. Unemployment rose and consumer spending fell. Marketers for De Beers diamonds, however, doubled their budget for 2008 and tried hard to convince consumers that diamonds were a good value for the holidays. It didn't work, and their profits were down for '08. What did they do wrong?  

### 3.5a Learning It: The Economic Environment
_Economic environment_: Factors that influence consumer behavior and marketing strategies.  

#### Stages of the Business Cycle
65% of GDP comes from consumer spending. Marketers must understand how the economic environment is influencing consumer decision making. Typically ther is a cycle of long periods of expansion and short periods of contraction (6 months of contraction is called a recession). Growth leads to prosperity and prosperity leads to an increase in consumer spending. Marketers succeed by targeting consumers and supplying them new products and promotions. Durring periods of contraction consumers change their habits, focusing on essencials. Marketers may lower prices, create value-lines, and promote special offers to attract consumer dollars.  

#### Change in Prices
Excess demand and/or excess manufacturing costs lead to inflation. Deflation, on the other hand, causes a loss in profits, and can lead to layoffs. Layoffs in turn creates demand for lower prices, as consumers have fewer dollars to spend.  

#### Employment and Income
_Unemployment_ is the percentage of people looking for work within the economy. Contractions should have higher unemployment, expansion should have lower unemployment.  
_Discretionary income_ is the amount of money left after consumers have purchased their necessities.  

Periods of major innovation are historically accompanied by increases in living standards and incomes.

### 3.5b Closing Example
De Beers misread the economic environment and believed their target consumers would be ready to purchase their product. Instead consumers delayed purchase of luxury items. They might have faired better by lowering prices or running special promotional offers.  

## 3.6 The Technological Environment
"Describe how a change in the technological environment can impact a firm's marketing activities."  

### Opening Example
Marcelina Rousseau has a luxury brand called MR Luxe purses and wallets. Knock offs are eating into profits, as well as impacting the brand's reputation, as unsuspecting consumers are purchasing counterfeit products and complaining about the quality. How can Marcelina and her company assure customers they have purchased a genuine product?  

### 3.6a Learning It: The Technological Environment
_Technological environment_: Application of innovations and inventions based in scientific discovery. Technology can reduce consts, improve products, create new products and render old products obsolete.  

The RFID chip is an example of a new technology being applied to change consumer and maketing behaviors. Originally used for dogs, these chips can track inventory, as well as people. Disney's MagicBands are worn on the wrist. Visitors use them to open doors, make purchases, access privilages within the amusement park,a nd more. This also means that their individual behaviors can be tracked and used for marketing, including targeted marketing. While there are some privacy concerns with this, the information gathered is valuable to Disney's marketers.  

By keeping up with technology, marketers can find a comptitive edge using innovative products and technologies to improve products, reduce costs, and open new markets.  

### 3.6b Closing Example
MR Luxe incorporated RFID tags into their products and released a mobile app that consumers can use to authenticate the authenticity of their item.  

## 3.7 The Social-Cultural Environment
"Determine an effective marketing response to a change in the social-cultural environment."  

### Opening Example
Food Town markets sales were declining despite nonew entrants in their competitive environment. Upon reviewing their product categories they found that although sales overall were down, sales in frozen and prepared foods were up. The conclusion was that the social-cultural environment had shifted, and their customers are busy with work and family, and that products saving them time around meal preperation had the potential to be successful.  

### 3.7a Learning It: The Social-Cultural Environment
_Social-cultural environment_ defines the relationship between marketing and society. Cultural trends, age and ethnic demographics, affluence, and education (among other factors) all impact marketer's strategies.  

Health-care, travel and leisure, financial management products can all be marketed to retiring baby boomers.  

Increased spanish language entertainment like news, movies, and television shows can help service providers like satelite, cable, and internet providers capture the growing Hispanic demographic.  

Consumerism, legal protections for consumers, and consumers belief that they have rights around their consumption, impact the social-cultural environment. Some organizations are even creating public policy research departments to study these changes and the potential impact.  

### 3.7b Closing Example
The market research firm NPD Group reports that less than 60% of home meals are prepared at home. People want to eat healthy foods at resonable prices. Food Town focused on this social-cultural change in their consumers and invested in creating prepared meals to take home. These are priced lower than, and represent a threat of replacement to, full-service and fast-service restaurants.  

## 3.8 Ethical Issues in Marketing
"Given a variable of the marketing mix, describe an ethical issue related to that variable."  

### Opening Example
The manager of a Courtyard by Marriott, near the JFK Airport, reacted to a snow storm by raising the cost of rooms by $100 a night. He new flights would be canceled and that travelers would be willing to pay the extra cost for a warm room and a shower. The assistant manager thought this kind of exploitative behavior was not a good idea.

### 3.8a Learing It: Ethical Issues in Marketing
_Marketing ethics:_ The marketers' standards of conduct and values.  
Each of the 4Ps of the marketing mix has associated ethical issues for the marketer to evaluate.

### 3.8b Ethics in Product Strategy
Planning for obsolescence makes sense when technology will inevitably render the product obsolete. However, is it ethical to plan obsolescence for products that don't have to be obsolete? I can still get razors for my Gillete Twin razor, eventhough Gillete sells generations of newer razor products.  
Packaging that uses odd sizes to take up shelf space, grab consumer attention, or create challenges in price comparisons may be consdered unethical. Concave bottle bottoms for products under presure may add stability to the product, whereas non-functional concave bottoms may simply try to make the portion appear larger.  

### 3.8c Ethics in Price Strategy
Price gouging is the increasing of a products price when unexpected conditions like a natural disaster cause the supply to drop and demand to rise (think of bottled water after a devistating earthquake). It is considered unethical, and typically it is illegal. But venues like Fenway Park adjust pricing based on the demand of the visiting team. These prices are listed well in advance, and such pricing is not considered unethical.  

### 3.8d Ethics in Distribution Strategy
Should franchiser be required to purchase materials and services from the parent organization? Should marketers be expected to serve small market segments and underserved communities?  

### 3.8e Ethics in Promotion Strategy
Truth in advertising is considered the ethical way to promote products. Some targt groups may be more succeptable to influence and preasure (think children). And some may not have the resources for purchases that they are effectively marketed (like selling cars and loans to college students). Is it ethical for an alcohol company to give branded items to minors?  

### 3.8f Closing Example
What the manager of the Courtyard by Marriott did was price-gouging, and illegal in New York. The hotel was ordered to pay customers $48,000 in restitution, and a fine of $17,500 to the state.  

## 3.9 Social Responsibility
"Define the four dimensions of social responsibility."  

### Opening Example
IBM believes Corporate Social Responsibility is a vital part of its business as a global firm.
