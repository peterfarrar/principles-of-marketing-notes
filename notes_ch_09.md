### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
REI is more than just an outdoor, sporting goods retail cooporative. It also has an adventure travel business called REI Adventures. They would like to grow this part of the business. How can they best identify the right target audience, and not waste marketing dollars on the wrong individuals?  

## 9.1 Types of Market
"Describe the two primary market classifications."  

### Opening Example
PepsiCo is the leader in marketing some fo the fastest growing categories of beverages: water, juices, and sports drinks. They use a dual marketing approach to promote their products, one for consumers and another for businesses (like restaurants and grocers). How does the type of market influence their marketing strategy. Why is it important that marketers understand the difference between the two?  

### 9.1a Learning It: Types of Market
"A **market** is a group of people with sufficient purchasing power, authority, and willingness to buy."  

There are two general types of markets. _Consumer products_ are purchased by consumers. These are things like a toothbrush, a ticket to the baseball game, a pair of sunglasses, groceries. _Business products_ are directly or indirectly used in the production of a business' products (goods or services). Businesses might buy things like raw steel, lumber, an office building.  
There are crossover products, like a car for the family, vs. a fleet of cars for a services organization, a bar of soap for the home bathroom vs. bulk orders of individual sized soaps for a chain of hotels to place in each guest room. These questions will determine which market the product is in:  
* Who will buy it?
* How or why will it be used?

Different markets require a different marketing strategy.  

### 9.1b Closing Example
Pepsi has a different strategy for consumer marketing than for businesses. They use commercials, like adds on TV, or internet campaigns, branding, to reach consumers. While businesses require a personal, possibly long term, relationship. For business customers, like restaurants and grocers, Pepsi uses sales representitives to reach them.  

## 9.2 Criteria for Effective Market Segmentation
"Summarize the three components necessary for effective marketing segmentation."  

### Opening Example
Design Basics is a Nebraska-based home plan design company. They want to identify the correct market segments to market to. How should they go about segmenting the market to identify their best target market?  

### 9.2a Learnig It: Criteria for Effective Market Segmentation
Effective marketing needs to identify the correct segment of the market that is most likely to purchase their products. **Market segmentation** is the dividing of a market into smaller, somewhat homogeneous groups. Determining useful ways to segment a market helps marketers succeed in communicating with the right consumers. A viable market segment needs to meet three criteria:
* Significant in size and purchasing power
* Profitable
* Consistent with the firm's marketing capabilities

#### Significant in Size and Purchasing Power
Is the segment large enough and have the purching power (authority and discretionary income) to warrant targeting them?  

#### Profitable
Is enough of the segment able to afford the product? Especially if selling a high end product, the market segment needs to have the wealth to purchase it, as opposed to a less expensive similar item (Example, Mercedes vs. Ford).  

#### Consistent with the Firm's Marketing Capabilities
To be a viable market segment, the organization needs to be able to market to them. This could require adjusting their branding, modifying their product, or other changes that the organization would have to be comfortable doing.  

Market segmentation is about identifying a set of traits that seperates a sub-group within a market from the rest of the market. Understanding this groups characteristics is essential to develop a successful, targeted marketing strategy. Characteristics include buying patterns, income, location, age and gender.
