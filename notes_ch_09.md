### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
REI is more than just an outdoor, sporting goods retail cooporative. It also has an adventure travel business called REI Adventures. They would like to grow this part of the business. How can they best identify the right target audience, and not waste marketing dollars on the wrong individuals?  

## 9.1 Types of Market
"Describe the two primary market classifications."  

### Opening Example
PepsiCo is the leader in marketing some fo the fastest growing categories of beverages: water, juices, and sports drinks. They use a dual marketing approach to promote their products, one for consumers and another for businesses (like restaurants and grocers). How does the type of market influence their marketing strategy. Why is it important that marketers understand the difference between the two?  

### 9.1a Learning It: Types of Market
"A **market** is a group of people with sufficient purchasing power, authority, and willingness to buy."  

There are two general types of markets. _Consumer products_ are purchased by consumers. These are things like a toothbrush, a ticket to the baseball game, a pair of sunglasses, groceries. _Business products_ are directly or indirectly used in the production of a business' products (goods or services). Businesses might buy things like raw steel, lumber, an office building.  
There are crossover products, like a car for the family, vs. a fleet of cars for a services organization, a bar of soap for the home bathroom vs. bulk orders of individual sized soaps for a chain of hotels to place in each guest room. These questions will determine which market the product is in:  
* Who will buy it?
* How or why will it be used?

Different markets require a different marketing strategy.  

### 9.1b Closing Example
Pepsi has a different strategy for consumer marketing than for businesses. They use commercials, like adds on TV, or internet campaigns, branding, to reach consumers. While businesses require a personal, possibly long term, relationship. For business customers, like restaurants and grocers, Pepsi uses sales representitives to reach them.  

## 9.2 Criteria for Effective Market Segmentation
"Summarize the three components necessary for effective marketing segmentation."  

### Opening Example
Design Basics is a Nebraska-based home plan design company. They want to identify the correct market segments to market to. How should they go about segmenting the market to identify their best target market?  

### 9.2a Learnig It: Criteria for Effective Market Segmentation
Effective marketing needs to identify the correct segment of the market that is most likely to purchase their products. **Market segmentation** is the dividing of a market into smaller, somewhat homogeneous groups. Determining useful ways to segment a market helps marketers succeed in communicating with the right consumers. A viable market segment needs to meet three criteria:
* Significant in size and purchasing power
* Profitable
* Consistent with the firm's marketing capabilities

#### Significant in Size and Purchasing Power
Is the segment large enough and have the purching power (authority and discretionary income) to warrant targeting them?  

#### Profitable
Is enough of the segment able to afford the product? Especially if selling a high end product, the market segment needs to have the wealth to purchase it, as opposed to a less expensive similar item (Example, Mercedes vs. Ford).  

#### Consistent with the Firm's Marketing Capabilities
To be a viable market segment, the organization needs to be able to market to them. This could require adjusting their branding, modifying their product, or other changes that the organization would have to be comfortable doing.  

Market segmentation is about identifying a set of traits that seperates a sub-group within a market from the rest of the market. Understanding this groups characteristics is essential to develop a successful, targeted marketing strategy. Characteristics include buying patterns, income, location, age and gender.  

### 9.2b Closing Example
Design Basics market segmentation identified women as a viable target market for home plan designs.

This segment meets all three criteria, and so is worth pursuing.  

## 9.3 Geographic Segmentation
"Describe four types of geographic segmentation."  

### Opening Example
Where would be a good place to open a new Walgreens? Geographic segmentation can help identify a profitable location, and the right products to sell.  

### 9.3a Learning It: Geographic Segmentation
The four common bases for segmenting consumer markets:
* Geographic
* Demographic
* Psychographic
* Behavioral

For geographical segmentation there are four basic variables that help to identify a segments needs and potential profitability:

#### Market Size
The number of consumers in a geographical region. Large numbers of consumers might be advantagous for certain kinds of businesses, or knowing where large numbers of a businesses customers are might be useful for targeting them with marketing.  

#### Market Density
Urban areas have the greatest density, rural areas the least. This means very different lifestyles, and so different needs. Some businesses, like lawn care and auto manufacturers, do better in low density markets, while others do well in high density markets. High density markets can also sustain a greater number of similar businesses, like retaurants and convenience stores.  

#### Climate
Many products are climate specific. Bathing suits in December don't sell well in Minnesota, but may still sell in Florida or Southern California, where down jackets and snow shovels are unnecessary.  

#### Region
Regional differences involve more than the weather. Marketers need to understand the local culture, as well as other factors like income and education levels.  

### 9.3b Closing Example
Walgreens uses geographic segmentation to identify locations for stores, and market research to determine the products that consumers want to purchase in each region.  

## 9.4 Demographic Segmentation
"Summarize the five most commonly used demographic variables."  

### Opening Example
With revenues in 2019 of $64.4 billion for mobile, 29.6 billion for PCs, 15.4 billion for consoles, the gaming industry is a huge market opportunity. Gamers aren't just white boys, they come from all demographic segments. How can game companies identify and target gamers, to extract their share of the profits?  

### 9.4a Learning It: Demographic Segmentation
Using demographics is the most common method of market segmentation. Although helpful, this can also lead to steriotyping consumers, which can alienate or fail to target potential consumers. This should just be a starting point. There are five basic demographic variables:
* Gender
* Age
* Ethnicity
* Family Lifecycle Stages and Household Type
* Income and Expenditure

### 9.4b Closing Example
Despite steriotypes, an equal amount of men and women play videogames, although more men identify as "gamers." Men and women seem to play different types of games. Nintendo has brought more females onto it's development teams in hopes of developing more games to target women. Games rated "M for Mature" tend to be violent games, and predominantly played by males.  

## 9.5 Psychographic Segmentation
"Contrast psychographic segmentation with other segmentation variables."  

### Opening Example
Many programs on streaming services and cable rely on advertising to generate revenue. How can producers draw advertising to their offerings? Demographic segmentatin is an important tool for this. And increasingly, so is psychographic segmentation.  

### 9.5a Learning It: Psychographic Segmentation
**Psychographic Segmentation** differentiates population groups by values and lifestyle factors. Lifestyles include attitudes, values, social activities, media usage habits, etc.  

Typically, psychographic profiles are created by conducting large surveys (by organizations like the _Pew Research Center_) asking consumers to agree or disagree with a variety of statements around activities, interests, and opinions.  

Psychographic data can be combined with geographic and demographic data to form a more useful image of a target market.  

Many marketers use [PRIZM](https://claritas.com/prizm-premier/), a leading segmentation service that blends data from different segmentation methods into 68 segments. This can halp marketers plan new products, distribution channels, and advertising campaigns.  

### 9.4b Closing Example
Using psychographics can help marketers identify the kind of marketing campaign that can reach a given market durring a particular kind of programming.  

## 9.6 Behavior Segmentation
"Describe the three forms of behavioral segmentation."  

### Opening Example
Some beverages seem to be enjoyed across demographic and psychographic segments. Examples are energy drinks, bottled water, coke. Does this mean segmentation can't help marketers develop their strategies?  

### 9.6a Learning It: Behavior Segmentation
Not all households with an income over $200,000 are going to want to buy a fancy car, or fancy clothes. Not everyone in the country hunts. Demographics only provide a slice of the picture. **Behavioral Segmentation** focuses on how people behave. This segmentation can be very helpful to marketers, alowing them to market to actual behaviors.

### 9.6b Closing Example
Market segmentations are important in the beverage industry. Beverage marketers can use behavioral segmentation in their desicion making process. Understanding _benefits sought_, _usage rates_, and _brand loyalty_ can inform their strategy.  

## 9.7 Strategies for Reaching Target Markets
"Distinguish between the three basic strategies for reaching target markets."  

### Opening Example
The internet has changed the way the travel industry operates. Consumers can use the world wide web to compare prices, purchase hotels and flights, rent cars, all without the help of a travel agent. Without travel agents to market to, travel and hospitality companies must find new ways to market their goods and services. And not all will use the same strategy.

### 9.7b Closing Example
Travel and leisure service providers may utilize different strategies, depending on their target markets. Mass marketing is effective for a discount airline or rental car service. Differenciated marketing is effective for consumers willing to spend a little more for more perks and higher levels of service. And concentrated marketing can create luxury experiences for wealthy travelers that don't want to deal with lines and crowds.  

## 9.8 Positioning Strategies and Value Propositions
"Explain how marketers build value propositions utilizing positioning strategies."  

### Opening Example
Core Natural Water is a new "functional water" product, meaning it contains vitamines and minerals, created by producer/songwriter Dr. Luke. Katy Perry, Diplo, and Ellie Goulding are its music brand ambassadors, as well as investors. Core Natural Waters needs to be clear baout its _value proposition_ to succeed in this highly competitive market.  

### 9.8a Learning It: Positioning Strategies and Value Propositions
_Positioning_ is the strategy of creating a distinct image or identity for a brand or product in the minds of consumers. It differentiates itself from its competition and ensures that consumers perceive it in a way that creates a strong relationship. This can improve sales, satisfaction, and loyalty. Positioning is influenced by factors like pricing, quality, features, target audience, and brand messaging.

A _value proposition_ can use one or more positioning strategy, with the goal of differenciating the product from it's competitors.  
A _positioning map_ is a graphical representation of how consumers perceive various brands and/or products rank when compared to their competitors. It is typically a two axes graph with one axis for the cost and another for the perceived quality.

Marketers can use positioning maps to recognized if a position is crowded (to be avoided) or untapped (an opportunity).   

### 9.8b Closing Example
Dr. Luke focuses on value, attributes, and application, differenciating Core Natural Water from its competitors by targeting the ideal PH for human bodies to absorb essencial vitamins and minerals.  

## 9.9 Classifying Segmentation Variables
"Given a target market profile, classify each variable according to its base of segmentation."  

### Opening Example
In order to grow their customer base, REI Adventures is using the REI customer database of email addresses, and related customer information, for marketing. The database has exactly the kind of target audience that would be interested in their service, but they don't think it's going to have enough people to reach their customer acquisition target. How can they find more people like the ones in their database?  

## 9.9a Learning It: Classifying Segmentation Variables
Facebook is able to take a list of email addresses, like the ones REI Adventures has, and identify those that are in their massive userbase. Then it can perform analysis on the results, based on the users' posts and profiles. They can identify commonalities amongst the members of the group based on traits like age, gender, education, interests, behaviors, etc. Using these traits, it can identify "lookalike audiences" within its userbase. Companies like REI can use this service to find members of its target market, and deliver advertising to them.  

## 9.10 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
REI was able to combine the audience and their segmentation data with personal digital advertising services from Jivox to deliver customized adds to potential customers based on weather and location data, as well as other traits collected from Facebook and the REI customer database.
