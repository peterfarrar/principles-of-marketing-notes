#### Product
A **product** is a good or service (or idea).  
Products are layered. A _product strategy_ can also include:  
* Customer service
* Package design
* Brand names
* Trademarks, patents, warranties

Example: Starbucks sells coffee, but it also sells an atmosphere (the physical space), a brand (reputation for quality), and a service (helpful, friendly baristas).  

#### Price
_Price strategy_ is the art of pricing a product to be competitive and profitable. Environmental factors like natural disasters and socio-economical factors can also affect pricing strategy.  

#### Place (Distribution)
A _distribution strategy_ should insure that products are available to the consumer in the quantity they desire as close (physically or technologically) to them as possible (ideally, right where they are).  
Decisions to realize a strategy can include how items are stored, transported, delivered, and the channels through which they are marketed.  
Amazon is a great example of an evolving and successful distribution strategy. You can order the item on your phone (exactly where you are). They have warehouses distributed across the globe and can deliver from the closest location to your location using any number of delivery services, including their own. Orders of some items can arrive within hours.  

#### Promotion
**Promotion** is at it's core, communication. Organizations use various channels to communicate with their _target market_ (potential customers). They communicate what their products offer, how it is different from the competition, price incentives, loyalty programs, etc. It is common that a _promotional strategy_ mix together many aspects of these communications in to a unified message. Integrated marketing communications (IMC) coordinates delivering the unified message through the various channels.  

## Chapter 2: Strategic Planning in Contemporary Marketing
### The Marketing Planning Process
The planning process consists of six steps that follow in the same order as the sections of the marketing plan:  

1. Define the mission of the organization
2. Determine organizational objectives
3. Assess organizational resourcess and evaluate risks and opportunities in the environment (SWOT)
4. Develop a marketing strategy
5. Implement Strategy through operational plans
6. Monitor the progress and gather feedback neccessary to adapt the strategy

#### Mission Statement
A mission statement is a concise declaration of an organization's core purpose, goals, and values. It explains why the organization exists, what it does, and who it serves  

#### Organizational Objectives
Organizational objectives are specific, measurable goals that a company or institution sets to achieve its mission and vision. They guide decision-making, align team efforts, and provide a benchmark for success.  

#### SWOT Assessment
A SWOT assessment (or SWOT analysis) is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate an organization's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It helps businesses, teams, or individuals make informed decisions by analyzing internal and external factors.  

#### Marketing Strategy
A marketing strategy is a long-term plan that outlines how a business will attract and retain customers, differentiate itself from competitors, and achieve its marketing goals. It defines who the target audience is, what the business will offer, and how it will promote its products or services.  

#### Operational Planning
Operational planning is the process of defining the specific actions, resources, and timelines needed to achieve an organization's strategic goals. It focuses on the short-term execution of tasks and ensures that daily operations align with the broader business strategy.  

#### Monitor and adapt
The final step in the marketing planning process involves tracking performance, collecting feedback, and making necessary adjustments to improve the strategy. Businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, website traffic, engagement rates, and customer feedback to assess whether the marketing efforts are achieving their goals  

## Chapter 3: The Marketing Environment, Ethics, and Social Responsibility
### The External Marketing Environment

To make decisions about _target markets_ and the marketing mix (_Product/Price/Place/Promotion_), marketers need to consider five dimensions of the marketing environment:  

#### Competitive
The actions of competitors, market trends, industry dynamics, and competitive strategies that influence a company’s ability to differentiate itself and succeed.  

#### Political-legal
Government policies, regulations, trade laws, taxation, and political stability can affect how businesses operate, market, and expand.  

#### Economic
These include economic conditions such as inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, consumer purchasing power, and overall economic growth, which can affect consumer spending and business operations.  

#### Technological
This includes advancements in technology, innovation, automation, and digital transformation that can impact product development, marketing strategies, and competitive advantages.  

#### Social-cultural
These involve societal trends, demographics, cultural attitudes, and lifestyle changes that influence consumer behavior and demand for products or services.  

These dimensions can impact and influence each-other. For example socio-cultural concerns can lead to political-legal regulations which have an economic impact, shaping competitive behaviors in the market.

#### Global Reach
The internet allows smaller businesses, that might have once been limited to being local, to reach customers across the globe. It also allows independent agents to organize communities to support their activities without the same overhead (cost and management).  

#### Personalization
Web pages and marketing campaigns can use data collected through various sources, including their own interactions, to customize experiences to individual consumers.  

#### Interactive Marketing
_Interactive marketing:_ Companies can deliver content via apps on mobile phones based on events including special dates, events, even location.  

#### Right-Time Marketing
Marketers can use criteria like web activity to deliver content when it is most relevent to the consumer. Example: searching for a hotel in Madrid? That's a good time to deliver adds to that consumer for a hotel in Madrid.  

#### Integrated Marketing
The internet and apps can be coordinated with other mediums to deliver a unified campaign to consumers. Digital marketing can reinforce billboards, television and radio adds, instore advertizing, and other sources of advertising and communication.  

## Chapter 5: Social Media: Living in the Connected World
## How Consumers Use Social Media

91% of consumers visit stores because of an experience they had online. 90% of consumers research products online, more than 67% purchasing the item in-store. Facebook (in 2015) influenced half of on and off line purchases.  
Researching on line is split between social media and search engines, with most consumers using both.  
47% of millinneals are influenced by social media, and 19% of older shoppers.  
Consumers use online communities in three ways:  
1. _Discovering new products (goods and services):_ 28% of people polled by comScore and Group M Search sited YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter as sources of information that helps them discover new brands.
1. _Conducting research and sharing information:_ Blogs and social networking sites provide information and allow feedback and exchanges. 40% of Americans use YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to discuss their healthcare.  
1. _Finalizing purchase decisions:_ 72% of consumers hold online reviews in high regard when deciding on a purchase. They propigate this out by participating in the same sites as they view.  

Marketers need to develop strategies around the way consumers use social media and the internet.  

## Chapter 6: Consumer Behavior
### Social Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
Five social factors influence consumer purchase decision making:
1. Culture
2. Social Class
3. Reference Groups
4. Family
5. Opinion Leaders

#### Cultural Influences
Culture is the collection of core values, preferences, tastes, and beliefs, typically handed from one generation to another with little change. Subcultures include unique behaviors and values within a culture. In the U.S. there are many ethnic subgroups that have their own unique preferences as well. Marketing strategies can be improved and targeted by understanding target cultures and their subcultures. Simply put, what works in one country or culture may not work in another. Marketers need to be sensitive to this, and to changes in what is popular in a given group.  

#### Social Class
Class is based on occupation, education level, income, wealth, among other factors. Income and wealth in particular influence how much disposable income (discretionary spending) a household has. This in turn influences where consumers shop and what they decide to purchase.  

#### Reference Groups
Reference groups may be people, organizations, or institutions. They have opinions that are valued and influence an individuals behavior and values. The two strongest factors in how influencial reference groups are to the individual are:
* _The visibility of the product to others:_ High social risk is associated with highly visible products like clothing and cars. Reference groups will have a high level of influence on purchasing decisions of these items.  
* _The purchaser's suceptibility to influence:_ Some people are simply more suseptible to being influenced by their reference groups. Young people often fall into this category.  

#### Opinion Leaders
Opinion leaders are influencers within a refrence group. They tend to share their opinions, which can influence others considering a product. Social media can amplify their influence.  

#### Family
Family is what one is born into and what one forms for themselves. This is a highly influencial factor. Understanding family structure has had to adapt to modern times. Traditional roles have been replaced with two income households, fathers active in child care, husbands shopping for groceries. Marketers need to understand the different types of families in the modern world.  

### Psychological Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
Five internal attributes that influence consumer decision making include:
1. Needs and Motives
2. Perceptions
3. Attitudes
4. Learned Responses
5. Self-Concepts  

#### Needs and Motives
Behavior is driven by a perceived _need_ to change the consumers current state to a desired state.  

Maslow's theory of Hierarchy of Needs influences marketing strategy:

A person's _motives_ are what drive them to satisfy their need. They guide their behavior to achieve the desired state. Marketers attempt to make a need felt, then influence the consumer through their motive to purchase a specific product.   

#### Perception
People's _perception_ of a product is dependant on what they want to perceive, and have a strong influence on their behavior. Marketers use size, shape, color, logos, and other factors to evoke a favorable response from the mind of the consumer.  

#### Attitudes
A consumer's perception of a product is highly influenced by their attitudes. Attitudes are formed through experiences and affiliiations (social contracts) and can be highly resistant to change. Marketers want to influence consumers attitudes towards their brand (or market their brand to appeal to consumer attitudes).  

#### Learning
A change based on an experience. An initial positive experience with a product can create a repeat customer, as well as generate free word of mouth advertising to attract other customers. Significant resources are dedicated to creating a positive first impression. Free samples can provide this, and introduce consumers to products they might not have tried. Branding, loyalty programs, and bulk discounts can reinforce repeat business.

## Bonus question (true or false)
The text categorizes learning, in the context of marketing, as a psychological determinant in buying behavior. However, an argument could be made more generally that learning is often the result of social interaction. Ideas shared through social interaction can influence the learned response (psychological) of a consumer to a product.
