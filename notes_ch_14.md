### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Dollar General is a Tennesee based discount retailer. It also competes against grocery stores. They are able to sell brand names like Kimberly Clark, Procter & Gamble, Kellog, Hanes, Nabisco, and General Mills at a lower pricepoint than their competition. But they aren't actually selling the product for less. They sell smaller portions, but have higher margins. Because their customers have limited buying power, DG can sell them smaller sizes at lower prices, while charging more per ounce. We'll learn more about this pricing strategy in this chapter.  

## 14.1 How Price Affects Demand

"Explain how price elasticity affects potential demand for a product."  

### Opening Example

Two towns have popular downtown shopping districts with nearby parking. But Town A has five parking facilities and Town B has only one. The owner of one of Town A's facilities purchased the facility in Town B. Now he's raising all his prices. Which facility will lose more business as a result of the rate hike?  

### 14.1a Learning It: How Price Affects Demand

Pricing is a dynamic and impactful component of the marketing mix. There are more influences and strategies the marketer must consider when pricing a product.  

**Supply** refers to the quantity of a product offered at different prices (durring a specific period). Lower price points might not appeal to as many manufacturers, so there might be a lower supply. Higher prices tend to have larger supplies because more manufacturers produce items at the higher price point.  

**Demand** refers to the quantity of a product that consumers will purchase at different prices (durring a specific period). There tend to be fewer consumers willing to purchase items at higher price points.  

_Market equilibrium_ is the sweet spot where suppliers make just enough product at the right price so that consumers will purchase it all. The way this works in real life is a little sloppy. If something sells well, producers will make more, and competitors will enter the market producing an even larger supply. Because there are too many products on the market now, the prices will come down until consumers purchase enough of the product. Or, a lack of supply means that consumer demand can not be met, and consumers drive the price up until only those that are willing to pay the higher price can purchase the supply.  

When making pricing decisions, marketers need to be sensitive to the levels of supply and demand in their markets, and how any price changes will affect potential demand in the future.  

### 14.1b Price Elasticity

**Elasticity** is the measure of consumer responsiveness to price changes. **Price elasticity of demand** is the percentage change in the demand of the product, divided by the percentage of price change. Example: A 10% change in the price of eggs results in a 5% decrease in the quantity of eggs demanded. 5/10 = .5. The price elasticity of demand is 0.5.  

A price elasticity greater than 1, the demand for that product is considered elastic, meaning small changes can lead to significant reduction in demand. When the price elasticity is less than 1 the product is considered inelastic. Demand for the product is not particularly sensitive.  

It is important for marketers to have an understanding of the elasticity of a target market.  

#### Determinants of Elasticity

A major influence on elasticity is the availability of substitute products. Highly competitive industries are typically elastic because competitors market their products as substitutes for other brand's products. The internet lets consumers compare prices and brands more widely and easily. As a result, on line purchases tend to have greater elasticity.  

Generally, luxury goods are more elastic than those percieved as necessities.  

Elasticity also depends on the percentage of the consumers budget they are spending. Cheap items tend to be inelastic because the price change has minor impications for the consumer, whereas a price change in a car can demand a noticable percentage of the consumer's budget.  

### 14.1c Closing Example

Raising the price of the parking garage in a town with five facilities will exibit more elasticity, because there is greater competition. So the raise in price in Town A (with five facilities) will have a greater impact (reduction) on the lot owner's business than the change in Town B (which has only the one facility).  

## 14.2 Forcasting Demand

"Compare the primary types of forecasting methods used to determine demand."  

### Opening Example

A biotech firm is trying to determine if they should invest in cutting edge diagnostic technology. Before moving forward, the Directory of Marketing asks his marketing team to foracast demand for products based on the new technology. He also reaches out to top experts at biomedical research institutions like Johns Hopkins and Duke to hear how they percieve this technology could affect the market.  
What are the advantages of this type of foracsting, and what are the downsides?  

### 14.2a Learning It: Forcasting Demand

New product decisions, production scheduling, financial planning, inventory planning, pricing, and other business considerations rely heavily on _forecasts of future demand_. There are many techniques for this, falling in to two broad categories: qualitative and quantitative forecasting.  

**Qualitative forecasting** uses subjective data that reports opinions.  
**Quantitative forcasting** uses statistical data.

#### Qualitative Forcasting Techniques

##### Jury of Executive Opinion

Best for short-run forecasting, marketers ask the opinions of executives from different areas of expertise like marketing, finance, and production, and combines the feedback to predict future trends.  

##### Delphi Technique

Firms gather opinions both internally, and from external experts like researchers and professionals in relevant fields. The information is combined to form a long-term prediction. This technique has been used with success in particular with technological breakthroughs, but is expensive.  

##### Sales Force Composite

Opinions are gathered internally from people closest to the products, customers, and marketplace. Starting with the sales people on the ground, then district sales supervisors, and finally the head of sales, opinions are filtered up and used to generate predictions.  
Drawbacks to this approach include the human awareness that the information provided might be used to judge their own future performance (think sales quotas), the sales force often make conservative estimates. Front line workers are also regional, and so will have difficulty predicting conditions in other regions.  

##### Survey of Buyer Intentions

Interviews and questionnaires are used to gain a picture of customer intentions. This can be useful for short-term predictions. It's more effective with markets that have a limited number of customers. It's simply impractical to try to get a large enough sample to predict behavior of millions of customers. Also, buyer intention may not translate into sales.  

#### Quantitative Forcasting Techniques

##### Test Marketing

Useful for assessing consumer responses to new products. Nashville, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis are in the top ten cities for test markets because of their income, age, and gender distribution.  
Test marketing also lets marketers experiment with different pricing, promtotional strategies, and other marketing mix variations. The advantage of test markets is that they are real markets and real numbers. However, test marketing is expensive and time consuming.   

##### Trend Analysis

Historical sales data is used to inexpensively predict future sales.   

### 14.2b Closing Example

The biotech firm used the Delphi technique because, although costly, it is effective at making long-run predictions for new, potentially breakthrough products.  

## 14.3 Pricing Strategies

"Contrast three primary competitive pricing strategies"  

### Opening Example

Sizzler is known for affordable steak platters like their $16.99 sirloin and lobster special. Outback Steakhouse meets or beats Sizzlers basic prices, but also upsells platers like filet, instead of sirloin, with two sides, instead of one.  
What's the logic in Outback's pricing strategy and how does it apply to other markets?  

### 14.3a Learning It: Pricing Strategies

Firms choose pricing strategies based on their pricing objectives. This could include reaching a set sales volume, addressing competition, or demonstrating prestige. In general there are three pricing strategies.

#### Skimming Pricing Strategy

Also known as _market-plus_, the price is deliberately set higher than the competition. Companies can recoupe their investment for distinctive products before competitors enter the market, or try to establish prestige in an existing market.  

#### Penetration Pricing Strategy

Also known as a _market-minus_ pricing, a penetration pricing strategy sets the price deliberately lower than the competition. This is particularly effective when entering a market with many established competitors. Once established, the product price can be raised to match that of the competition.  

Retailers might use low prices, low-to-no interest rates on financing options, or two-for-one deals to encourage customers to visit their locations.  

Service providers may offer low initial contracts, with prices returning to "normal" after a set period of time.  

This strategy only works when overall demand increases as the price drops. That is not always the case. For example, some consumers may associate low price with low quality.  

#### Competitive Pricing Strategy

Maintain a price close to that of competitors (aka _competitive parity_). If prices go too low, competitors will follow and all will suffer.  

With all competitors offering similar pricing, marketers must emphasize other aspects of their product to distinguish it from the competition. This could include features, or additional services.  

### 14.3b Closing Example

Competitive pricing lets Outback de-emphazise the pricing of their competitors. Instead they concentrate on other parts of the marketing mix. They offer higher priced, higher quality items to differentiate.   

## 14.4 Pricing Tactics

"Outline three types of pricing tactics used by marketers."  

### Opening Example

Procter & Gamble (P&G) is one of the most successful marketers of cleaning and personal care items. Their premium brands include Tide, Bounty, ande Charmin. So why do they also carry cheaper alternatives like Cheer, Bounty Basic, and Charmin Basic?

### 14.4a Learning It: Pricing Tactics

Having established the overall pricing strategy, a firm supports that strategy using pricing tactics like psychological, product-line, and promotional pricing.  

#### Psychological Pricing

The belief that certain prices or price-ranges make products more appealing to consumers. This could be prestige pricing, or odd-pricing, like charging $9.95 instead of $10.00, leading consumers to think of the $9.00 + some change, instead of $10.  

#### Product-Line Pricing

Setting a limited number of price selections for a range of merchandise. A firm might have tiers of product lines. Once the consumer has identified which pricing tier they are comfortable with, they can focus on which products in that line meets their needs. Retailers may offer similar lines from different producers at different price ranges, or a producer may offer different tiers of similar products with each line having distinguishing characteristic that justify the price difference.    

Challenges with product-line pricing are around adding new products that may not fit in all lines, or with pricing that's outside of the standard ranges. This could lead to a reorginizing of the lines, causing consumer confusion and/or dissatisfaction.  

#### Promotional Pricing

Setting prices lower than normal _temporarily_ is a tactic to draw customers in to the store or brand line. Using **loss leaders** (goods sold below cost) can be a part of this tactic. Retailers hope that loss leaders will draw in customers that purchase related goods. For example: On Thanksgiving, offering turkeys below cost could be worth it if consumers purchase other products for the Thanksgiving day meal in the same trip.  

### 14.4b Closing Example

P&G use product-line pricing to sell to different groups of consumers, with the strategy of gaining overall market shares in the product space.  

## 14.5 Price and Perception of Quality

"Explain how price affects consumer perceptions of quality."  

### Opening Example

Sol wants to purchase a bottle of wine for his friends dinner party. His friend likes Cabernet, so Sol considered bottles between $12.99 and 24.50. When a sales person suggested a much cheaper bottle, calling it the best value they've ever had, Sol turned it down. Why did Sol choose to spend more?  

### 14.5a Learning It: Price and Perception of Quality

Price is often associated with quality. Many prestige companies put great effort in to preventing any discounting of their products, fearing it could negatively impact their brands status. More mainstream products like Apple also avoid discounting to maintain their brands premium image.  

Studies at California Institute of Technology demonstrated the impact of price on perception in a blind study. They presented two wines in five bottles and told the tasters that the five bottles contained prices ranging from fie to ninety dollars in price. Tasters prefered the more expensive wines. Brain scans confirmed more activity when drining the higher priced bottles. But as stated, the cheap wines and the expensive wines were actually the same wines.  

Prestige also includes paying more for eco-friendly products. Consumers are willing to pay more, assumedly, because they believe they are being altruistic? At the other end of the scale, lower priced items may differenciate themselves by promising a higher quality for the price.  

### 14.5b Closing Example

Sol chose a more expensive bottle because he percieved the lower priced bottle as inferior. He hadn't actually tried the cheaper bottle, but based his percieption on price alone.  

## 14.6 Pricing and the Law

"Describe the legal constraints on pricing."  

### Opening Example

Woodman's grocery chain has about 15 store. The Clorox company had been selling them solid brands like Glad bags and Clorox bleach at the same price as they sold to Costco and Sam's Club. They they changed their pricing, sighting the chains small size. Woodman's sued. Clorox argued that the case was moot because it would no longer sell to Woodman's at any price. What was the judge's decision?  

### 14.6a Learning It: Pricing and the Law

Federal, state, and local laws impact the pricing process as well. Sales tax is an example of laws that impact pricing. Some regulations exist to insure fair, transparent, and competitive pricing. Practices like scalping are illegal or restricted in some areas.  

#### Robinson-Patman Act

This act was passed in 1936, durring the depression, primarilly as a response to the rise of large grocery chains. It prohibits _price discrimination_ when selling the same product in the same amount to two different customers. Difference in price must reflect actual cost differentials, like transportation costs for remote or distant locations. It also prevents undercutting prices to drive the competition out of business. Companies can discount items, but must be able to demonstrate that in doing so they are not restricting competition.  

#### Unfair-Trade Laws

Most states suppliment federal regulations with their own _unfair trade laws_. These require sellers to maintain minimum prices for comparitive merchandise. The idea in passing these laws was to protect small specialty shops from preditory practices by larger companies.  

### Federal Trade Commission

"Protecting America's Consumers" is the slogan of the FTC. They oversee enforcement of over 70 laws designed to prevent unfair business practices, practices that are anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair to consumers. And while most of these laws don't directly relate to pricing, they do influence it.  

### 14.6b Closing Example

The judge in the Woodman's vs. Clorox case refused to dismiss the case, sighting the Robinson-Patman Act. Companies are required to treat all customers equally, regardless of size.  

### 14.7 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Dollar General's strategy works well for segments with highly elastic demand and standardized products. They use competitive pricing, with market research in the form of surveying competetors prices. They also carry items at a higher price point to also attract customers that can pay a little more.
