### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Pizza is a $39 billion industry, with 3 billion pizzas sold a year in the U.S. That's 46 slice per person, per year! Chains are continuing to grab more of the market, as the independant shops are loosing them. Even the best slice of pizza wont sell if the price is wrong. There are core pricing concepts that can help marketers determine what to charge, explaining the relationship between cost, demand, and profitability.  

## 13.1 Foundations of Pricing Strategy

"Describe the tree foundations of pricing strategy."  

### Opening Example

Travis was a barista, now he owns a mobile coffee shop. He shares his scheudled location and product and product specials information on Facebook. To be successful he needs to price his products properly. How should he determine his pricing?  

### 13.1a Learning It: Foundations of Pricing Strategy

**Price** refers to the funds required to purchase a product. Marketers understand that price plays a critical role in consumer decision making and adjust the marketing mix accordingly. Three foundations of pricing strategy are discussed.  

#### The Influence of Costs on Pricing Decisions

At the bear minimuim, pricing must cover the cost of manufacturing the product. Ideally, it also covers other organizational costs and even generates profit.  

#### Potential Demand and Pricing Decisions

The higher the pricing of a product, the fewer people will be willing to buy it, until the maximum price is surpassed, at which no one will buy it.  
The relationship between price and demand can be driven by multiple factors.  

#### Competition and Pricing Decisions

Competition is the third foundational pricing strategy. If competitors can produce a product for less, they can sell it for less. The organization either finds a way to reduce product cost, or a way to differentiate to justify the higher price.

### 13.1b Closing Example

Travis needs to consider all three foundations of pricing strategy. He needs to cover the expenses of the product, as well as those of running a business. This gives him his minimum price. He needs to make a profit, but the more he charges for a cup of coffee, the fewer he will sell. Being aware of competitors' pricing can help. If he can differenciate his product he may be able to charge a little more than the competition, or he may choose to price competitively, to match or undercut their prices.  

## 13.2 Pricing Objectives

"Summarize the three pricing objectives."  

### Opening Example

Brand preference can influence consumer decisions, but for many products price is often the deciding factor. Yusef is going to the grocery store and intends to compare prices closely. This isn't the only factor, he's considering quality too.  

### 13.2a Learning It: Pricing Objectives

The foundations of pricing strategy feed into the organizations **pricing objectives**. Company goals might be to capture the largest market share, to stay competitive, or to be percived as of high quality.

#### Volume or Sales Objectives

A company may increase sales volumes of a product by pricing it low. This could be because they have ample production capacity, or because they have the opportunity to distribute at large volumes, or because they believe they can generate more profit from selling higher volumes at a lower price.  
Temporary lowering of price can be used to leverage a larger share of the market.  

#### Competition Objectives

With a competitive objective, the pricing may be done to maintain parity between competitors. Undercutting can drive all prices down and reduce profitability, while **parity pricing** means all options in the space maintain their profit levels.  
another approach to competitive pricing is called **value pricing**. Emphasizing qualities of the product that can create the perception that the product has more value than the competition, and so is worth paying more for.  

#### Prestige Objectives

**Prestige pricing** establishes high prices to facilitate the impression of exclusivity and quality.

</div>

&nbsp;

Protein shakes and peanut butter appear to use a competitive pricing strategy. The lunchmeats show that one competitor is using the prestige pricing approach. And the tortilla chips indicate one manufacturer is using the pricing in line with a value objective.  

## 13.3 Calculating Markup and Margin

"Calculate pricing using the markup and margin methods."  

### Opening Example

Jamal and Kiran have opened a specialty bicycle shop named Spin. They want to use a simple approach for pricing their products. They learned what the average markups and margins used by other successful shops are. But they don't know how to calculate prices using that information.  

### 13.3a Learning It: Calculating Markup and Margin

Markup and margin are two straight forward approches for calculating price.  

#### Pricing Using Markup

**Cost-based pricing** is simply applying a markup percentage to the calculated cost of the item. For example, a product that costs $10 to make has a 10% markup applied. `10 x 0.1 = 11` so the final price is eleven dollars.  
Markup percentages are often based on industry norms, historical markup percentages, or profitability goals. Businesses might use one percentage across a range of products, or segment the products and apply markups by category.  

#### Pricing Using Margin

A margin is the percentage of the sales price left over after the sale. This is sometimes called **gross profit**. If a retailer wants to make 10% margin on a product that costs $10, he can calculate the price like this: `10/(1-.10) = 11.11` so the final price (rounded off) is eleven dollars and 11 cents.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

### 13.3b Closing Example

Jamal and Kiran determined that bikes tend to sell with a 40% margin and accessories tend to sell with a 60% margin. Understanding how to use this information lets them price their products with confidence.

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

&nbsp;

These prices appear to be competitive.  

## 13.4 Fixed and Variable Costs

"Differentiate between fixed and variable costs."  

### Opening Example

A fitness center offers monthly memberships for equiptment and basic classes, and charges additional fee per premium class. It also sells supplememnts and accessories. Premium classes requres hiring trainers. The owner needs to understand how to account for both their fixed and variable costs.  

### 13.4a Learning It: Fixed and Variable Costs

**Fixed costs** are things that stay relatively the same regardless of the level of production, like administrative staffing, lease or rent payments, and insurance. Because fixed costs don't change, it is relatively easy to figure them into the cost of a product.  

**Variable costs** include things that change with the level of production, like labor costs and raw materials. Variable costs are sometimes called price per unit. Scaling up may create efficiencies that lower the cost per unit. Because these costs can vary from month to month, they can be more challenging to calculate.  

### 13.4b Closing Example

The fitness center owner can calculate a basic membership price based on projected membership. If they beats that goal they will increase his profits because the fixed costs do not change. For variable costs, They need to pay careful attention to the current costs and price accordingly to insure profit from premium classes, supplements, and accessories.  

## 13.5 Breakeven Analysis

"Calculate breakeven point."  

### Opening Example

THe FitBracelet factory has opened. With 50% gross margin on the variable costs associated with manufacturing each unit ($100), the product is priced at a competitive $200 per unit. Fixed costs total $5 million for the first year. How does the FitBracelet company calculate the number of units they have to sell to break even?  

### 13.5a Learning It: Breakeven Analysis

**Breakeven analysis** is the method of determining how many units of a product must be sold to cover total (fixed and variable) costs.  

Each item made adds its cost to the total costs. The breakeven point is the point where the number of units sold generates revenue equal to the total costs. It is found using the following formula:  

```code
BreakevenPoint (in units) = TotalFixedCosts / GrossMargin (per unit)
```

In this context, gross margin may be called a **contribution margin**, because each unit is contributing this value towards the fixed costs.  

Berakeven analysis has some limitations:  

* Assumes costs can be clearly divided into fixed and variable categories.
* Assumes per-unit variable costs don't change at different levels of operation.
* Doesn't actually determine the product is priced correctly.

### 13.5b Closing Example

Using breakeven analysis, the number of units FitBracelet needs to sell to cover their cost in the first year is 50,000:  

```code
5,000,000 (fixed cost) / 100 (margin per unit) = 50,000 (units)
```

FitBracelet projects 75,000 units to sell, for a profit of $2,500,000.  

## 13.6 The Cost-Volume-Profit Relationship

"Describe how the cost-volume-profit relationship affects pricing strategy."  

### Opening Example

Mobility Transport Systems manufactures a product called the SafetySure gait belt. It's marketed to hospitals and caregivers, is priced at $10 and has a $4 gross margin. Gait belts are manufactured by many other companies as well. Their main competitor markets a similar product for $9. If MTS lowers their price to stay competitively priced, will the increased sales make up for the lower margins?  

### 13.6a Learning It: Cost-Volume-Profit Relationship

The interplay between price, demand, and profitability is called the **const-volume-profit (CVP) relationship**.

Just Deserts makes cheesecakes for six dollars and sells them for ten. They sell 800, but have capacity to bake 1,000. They consider lowering prices to use that capacity. But they also consider raising the prices to see how that would affect their profitability too. They perform the following CVP analysis:

They were pleasantly surprized to see that they would actually generate more profit by making fewer cheesecakes and charging more for them. They hope that by investing the increased revenue in marketing, they will slowly work production up to 800 again, while maitaining the higher margins.  

### 13.6b Closing Example

Mobility Transport Systems wondered if they should cut their prices. It's suggested they perform a CVP analysis to see if raising their prices might also be an option to consider.  

The CVP analysis demonstrates that in MTS's case, lowering the cost should increase profits. This is the choice they make.  

## 13.7 Applying Breakeven Analysis

"Given cost information and pricing objectives, calculate the breakeven point for a product."  

### Opening Example

Jane Dough is a pizza shop in a town of 20,000 people. Their annual revenu is $480,000. Their biggest competitor is the local Pizza Hut, with a revenue of $814,000. Pizza Hut has the benefit of the national chain's advertising, smartphone app, online ordering, and integration with social media.  
Jane Dough wants to grow their business and is considering adding delivery, online ordering, and is contemplating a smartphone app. They have hired a consultant to help analyze their current business and offer suggestions.  

### 13.7a Learning It: Applying Breakeven Analysis

Secondary research on the pizza restaurant business and learns of several issues impacting businesses:  

* Independent pizza store sales are down, chain store sales are up.
* Millenials are tech-savvy and like to shop on their phones and take photos of their purchases, including pizzas.
* Delivery services provide a competitive advantage
* Customers like healthy, natural ingredients

Using data from industry sources and data provided by Jane Dough, Pinnacle consultants prepared the following comparison:

          <td class="zebra">$190,000</td>
          <td class="zebra">$125,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <td class="zebra row-header">Average price of a large,<br />2-topping pizza</td>
          <td class="zebra">$11.00</td>
          <td class="zebra">$9.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <td class="zebra row-header">Variable cost per pizza<br />(ingredients, labor)</td>
          <td class="zebra">$4.00</td>
          <td class="zebra">$2.00</td>

      </tbody>

Even with the intention of prestige pricing, Jane Dough found their pricing was similar and they actually had had lower margins than Pizza Hut. They decided to stick with prestige pricing, and targeted a 77% margin.  

```code
$4 (cost) / (1 - .75) = $16 (per pizza) 
```

The higher cost would mean lower sales. But Jane Dough's customers tended to be less price sensitive than Pizza Hut's, prefering the higher quality product. CVP analysis suggested that profits would actually increase at the new price.  

Next they considered the added cost of offering delivery and an app. They determined this would add $100,000 to fixed costs, and calculated the breakeven point.  

```code
290,000 / (16 - 4) = 24,167 (pizzas to breakeven)
```

This number was well below previous sales. The decision is made to add a delivery service and an app to help customers order and enjoy Jane Dough's pizzas.
