### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
345 million Americans (>89%) and over 4.8 billion people world wide use the internet.  

_E-business:_ Using the internet to communicate with and provide services to customers and employees.  
_E-commerce:_ Buying and selling products and services online.  
_Digital marketing:_ Marketing goods and services over the internet. This can include apps, websites, email, etc.  

## 4.1 Opportunities Offered by Digital Marketing
"Summarize the five opportunities offered by digital marketing."  

### Opening Example
Brick and mortar stores can no longer rely on foot traffic and location to drive sales. E-commerce cuts into their sales. Digital marketing can drive customers to businesses in less heavily trafficed locations.

Sur la Table has instore cooking classes to attract customers. But customers need to know they exist. How can they use digital marketing to drive more traffic into their stores?  

### 4.1a Learning It: Opportunities Offered by Digital Marketing
#### Global Reach
The internet allows smaller businesses, that might have once been limmited to being local, to reach customers across the globe. It also allows independent agents to organize communities to support their activities without the same overhead (cost and management).  

#### Personalization
Web pages and marketing campaigns can use data collected through various sources, including their own interactions, to customize experiences to individual consumers.  

#### Interactive Marketing
_Interactive marketing:_ Companies can deliver content via apps on mobile phones based on events including special dates, events, even location.  

#### Right-Time Marketing
Marketers can use criteria like web activity to deliver content when it is most relevent to the consumer. Example: searching for a hotel in Madrid? That's a good time to deliver adds to that consumer for a hotel in Madrid.  

#### Integrated Marketing
The internet and apps can be coordinated with other mediums to deliver a unified campaign to consumers. Digital marketing can reinforce billboards, television and radio adds, instore advertizing, and other sources of advertising and communication.

### 4.1b Closing Example
Online retail continues to grow while traditional brick and mortar sales decline. Sur la Table has started streaming their cooking lessons and giving participants coupons for 10% discounts in their stores, or on their website.  

## 4.2 E-Business in the B2B Market
"List the four major forms of e-business in the business-to-business market."  

### Opening Example
B2B e-commerce is a huge part of the digital marketing environment. Contrasting consumer goods like Pepsi to business solution providers like FedEx, it's clear that FedEx's website is geared towards providing information and services for businesses. Retail businesses use providers like FedEx thousands of times a day to insure their products are delivered to their customers.  

### 4.2a Learning It: E-Business in the B2B Market
_Business to business (B2B)_ transactions are transactions between organizations, as opposed to business to consumer (B2C) transactions. B2B revenues are estimated to be twice that of B2C revenues.  

#### Electronic Data Interchainge (EDI)
EDI exchanges many kinds of business data via computer to computer connections, including: Advance ship notice, inventory statuses, projected inventory needs, purchase orders, invoices.  
Reduces paper, increases speed of transaction, reduces errors, improves production schedules.  

#### Extranets
_Extranets_ provide access to internal data through secured networks, allowing and improving collaboration between business partners.  

#### Intranet
_Intranets_ are networks internal to an organization that facilitate the secure sharing of business information across the organization. This could include documents, financial data, collaborative project data, scheduling, messaging, and analytics.  

#### Private Exchanges
_Private exchanges_ are websites where one organization can share information with internal and privilaged external business partners. This can help their suppliers, for example, with product forecasts by sharing sales data. Partners can work collaboratively using private exchanges to improve business outcomes.  

### 4.2b Closing Example
The internet has significant use in business to business transactions that typical consumers do not see and may be unaware of. A package arriving at a consumers address is the result of many B2B transactions, including pick-up, deliver, and tracking of the items.  

## 4.3 Benefits of Shopping Online
"Explain three reasons consumers prefer to ship online."  

### Opening Example
Compare the purchase of a TV from brick and mortar stores to the purchase of a TV over the internet. The time and travel, and limited research ability of the physical purchase experience is far more costly than the convenience of the internet.  

### 4.3a Learing It: Benefits of Shopping Online
_Business-to-consumer (B2C):_ Over $600 billion in online B2C sales in 2019. All major retailers now have an online presence. Online shopping provides advantages over traditional BnM stores. The three most often reasons consumers give for prefering online shopping: Competitive pricing, access and convenience, and personalized service.  

#### Competitive Pricing
Often the internet has the best pricing on products, and it is easy to compare prices and products online.  

#### Access and Convenience
Products are available 24/7. Services can help consumers locate products that they want, as well as similar products, and easily compare. Products often have easily accessable reviews. And online retailers typically allow consumers to create accounts, storing their payment and address details, making repeat purchases even easier.  

#### Personalized Service
Online retailers can collect data about consumers that let them personalize the experience. This can include dispalying items that they may be interested on the home page, addressing them by name, making suggestions based on previous purchases. Some retailers allow customers to personalize the product, choosing colors, patterns, etc.  

### 4.3b Closing Example
The internet purchaser is able to compare multiple vendors, read reviews, and repeat the process as their opinion changes. Online retailers also store payment and address information, making the purchase and delivery for repeat customers that much easier. The brick and mortar shopper is limited to what is there in the moment that they view it, and limited in sources of information. And repeating the process should their views change (i.e. deciding on a 48" TV instead of a 40" TV) is limited and time-consuming.  

## 4.4 Challenges Faced by Online Marketers and Consumers
"Summarize five challenges faced by online marketers and consumers."  

### Opening Example
Data collection and information breaches are the primary online concerns for consumers. What can marketers do to address these and other concerns?  

### 4.4a Learning It: Challenges Faced by Online Marketers and Consumers
Five primary challenges for online marketing:  

#### Safety of Online Payment
_Encryption_ is the primary technology for keeping data transferred across the internet safe. Browsers and secure payment systems implement encryption to protect these transactions. Third parties like PayPal also provide secure services to allow retailers and consumers to safely make payments and refunds without the retailer having to store, or even see, their customer's payment details.  

#### Privacy Issues
Consumers are highly concerned about their data being collected and used or misused without their knowledge. The European Commission has regulations to protect citizens of the EU's data. The FTC is considering a Do Not Track option (similar to Do Not Call). Internet privacy organizations like TRUSTe allow members to display an image on their websites, reasuring consumers that they that don't collect personal data without permission. And many sites display privacy policies to reasure, or at least provide transparency for, their customers.  

Companies are also concerned about protecting personal data. Data breaches can damage a companies reputation, reduce consumer confidence, and cost them revenue.  

#### Fraud and Scams
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) partners with organizations including the FBI to track and refer cyber fraud and other internet crimes. These crimes, like phishing, can steal passwords and install malware on users devices.  

Marketers are also concerned about getting scammed. Payment fraud (using fake or stolen creditcards, for example), and fradulent claims by consumers that their items never arrived, result in chargebacks that cost merchants money.  

#### Site Design and Customer Service
Web site design is a challenge for marketers. Sites need to look good and be easy for consumers to use. Many features can help, including chat boxes for questions, reviews for comparison shopping, and easy to find controls for making purchases.  

Beyond site design, customer service includes having items in stock, delivering them in a timely manor, handling complaints, concerns, and setting up a process for the customer and the business to handle returns. Good customer service provides a competitive advantage.  

#### Channel Conflicts
_Channel conflicts_ arise when a manufacturer offers their products direct to consumer on their website at a more competitive price than their retailers. While manufacturers may have success offering limited and special additions on their websites, if they out compete their primary channels, they risk losing those channels, and their primary source of revenue.  

### 4.4b Closing Example
Marketers can use encryption and secure services to protect consumer's data, and have more challenges of their own. Consumers can also take actions to protect their data, using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, limiting the amount of information they share, and using caution before clicking on links in emails and other electronic messages.  

## 4.5 Factors That Influence E-Commerce Success
"Summarize four factors that influence the success of an e-commerce website."  

### Opening Example
Pure Paleo Meals needs 40 new subscribers a day to cover its costs. Despite good press generating a 200% increase in traffic to their site, they are only getting 10-13 new subscribers a day. It's up to their Director of Marketing to figure out what's going wrong and fix it.  

### 4.5a Learning It: Factors That Influence E-Commerce Success
There are many kinds of e-business web sites. Some provide information like news and weather, others supply entertainment. Many of these generate revenue through advertising. But for an e-commerce site to succeed, it needs consumers to visit the site (traffic) and purchase products (conversions).  
Marketers often focus on four factors to help convert consumers into customers.: User experience, product offering, checkout process, and revenue maximization.  

### 4.5b User Experience
_User Experience (UX)_ is the experience the consumer has when visiting a site. Marketers goal should be a site that is pleasing to look at, easy to use, and provides the user the satisfaction they are seeking.  
Slow loading sites, sites with clutter, with unclear or complecated navigation and controls, lacking search functionality, and having too much text are generally considered to contribute to a negative UX.  
Designers should make pages clear, with plenty of space between items, simple and easy to use controls, including navigation, clear organization and search functionality that makes it easy for visitors to find and purchase the products they want or need.  

### 4.5c Product Offering
By identifying their target market, marketers can insure they offer products that meet the wants and needs of their customers. Providing detailed descriptions, appealing images, and "social proof", like reviews, can help consumer confidence and increase conversion rates.  

### 4.5d Checkout Process
Between 55% and 88% of customers fail to complete purchases they've initiated.  Some reasons:  
1. Checkout process was too long or too complicated
2. Website required they create an account
3. Shipping costs were too high
4. Lost trust in the site
5. Tax and shipping costs were introduced too late in the process and scared the customer away

Startegies to improve results include:  
* Simplified checkout requiring the minimal number of clicks
* Guest checkout, no account required
* Free or low-cost shipping for orders over a set price or quantity
* Secure checkout using SSL/TLS encrypted connections
* Reveal tax and shipping costs earlier in the process

### 4.5e Revenue Maximization
_Revenue maximization_ refers to strategies to encourage repeat business and larger transactions.  
Amazon uses recomendations to increase likelihood of purchases, including "frequently bought together" suggestions to encourage an increase in the value of the transaction, and uses its Prime membership, and its free, rapid shipping, to encourage repeat business.  

### 4.5f Closing Example
Pure Paleo Meals' Director of Marketing found several problems with the company website. The page was cluttered, making it difficult to find the right subscription model. The navigation was overly complicated, and inefficient at directing users to potentially profitable selections. The checkout process took the customer through six pages, which is way too many and takes too long. And users were required to create an account inorder to make a purchase.  
Focusing on overhauling the website resulted in a cleaner UX, a recomendation engine, easy checkout even without an account, and clear subscription choices. As a result, sign-up rates have tripled.  

## 4.6 Assessing the Effectiveness of an E-Commerce Site
"Describe the various methods for measuring the effectiveness of an e-commerce website."  

### Opening Example
Knowing the traffic of an e-commerce site is one way to judge its successfulness, but doesn't really provide enough information to be conclusive. 

### 4.6a Learing It: Assessing the Effectiveness of an E-Commerce Site
Important measurements used by online marketers:  

_Unique visitors:_ The number of potential customers visiting a site over a given time period. Analytics can also identify how visitors found their way to the site (other websites, search engines, advertisments, social media), which can help shape future marketing strategy.  

_Engagement:_ How much time a user spends on the site, and how many pages they browse. Tools like Google Analytics can provide this and other statistics that can help designers improve the efficacy of the site.  

_Conversion rate:_ The percentage of visitors that make a purchase.  
```
Conversion_Rate = Number_of_Purchases / Number_of_Visitors
```
Good UX, targeted offerings, and a good checkout experience can increase the conversion rate.  

_Click-through rate (CTR):_ The percentage of users who click came to the site by clicking on an add.  
```
ClickThrough_rate = Ad_clicks / Ad_impressions
```
An _impression_ is the number of times an add is shown to a consumer. Sites like Google and Facebook track click-through rates and prioritize adds with higher scores.  

_Conversion cost:_ This is the cost spent to generate a sale, and is possibly the most important metric in evaluating success. Each time a consumer clicks on an add, there is a charge. The number of sales that result from the compiled charges determines the conversion cost:  
```
Conversion_cost = CostPerClick / Conversion_rate
```

### 4.6b Closing Example
While knowing the number of visitors to a site is important, success can be better measured by other metrics, like conversion rate and conversion cost. Sites with fewer visitors may, infact, generate more revenue.  

## 4.7 Optimizing the Effectiveness of an E-Commerce Site
"Given an example of an online marketing activity, calculate the activity's effectiveness."  

### Opening Example
Pure Paleo Meals has successfully quadrupled their sales in the months following the site redesign, and is profitable. However new entrants in the industry, backed by large investors are deemed a threat.  
Strategy one: Media publicity blitz and online pay-per-click advertising.  
Strategy two: Test changes to the website that may increase conversion rates.  
Combining increased traffic and increased conversion rates could double customers signing up.  

### 4.7a Learning It: Optimizing the Effectiveness of an E-Commerce Site
"There are no expert marketers, only experienced marketers and expert testers."  
Using A/B testing (rotating multiple versions of aspects of the website, or the entire website) and multiple adds can help identify features and adds that can drive strategy to increase profitability.  

Calculating click-through rates, conversion rates, and conversion cost can determine which adds and features/version generate the most traffic and conversions.  

## 4.8 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Using A/B testing and multiple click-through adds, and calculating their success with metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and conversion cost allowed Pure Paleo Meals to focus on those that performed the best.
