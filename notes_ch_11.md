### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Viking Cruises is the largest river cruise line in the world. With the continuing growth in the cruise industry, it is important that they distinguish themselves.  
Viking specializes in smaller boats, without many of the distractions of other cruise lines, no waterslides, casinos, or movie theaters. Viking focuses on cultural experiences, spending more time touring cultural and historic spots ashore when other crusie lines might be encouraging travelers to stay on ship, spending money.  
Their target market watches PBS, 60 Minutes, and listen to NPR. These are the channels that Viking uses to connect to their potential customers. And more recently they have launched a travel channel called Viking TV, featuring programming related to their cruises.  

## 11.1 What Are Goods and Services?

"Distinguish between goods and services."  

### Opening Example

A-1 Construction Rentals rents and sells equiptment used for building projects. Their products include nail guns, moving vans with lift-gates, compressors, to concrete mixers. They also provide temporry services like poratble toilets and power poles.  
They offer both goods and services. When the building market is slow, they focus on selling used equiptment. And when the building market is strong, they focus on rental services to complement sites in need of extra equiptment.  
As they grow, they need to optimize their marketing strategy.  

### 11.1a Learning It: What Are Goods and Services?

Products are goods and services. **Goods** are _tangible_, like a car, a hamburger, or a screwdriver. **Services** are _intangible_, like a concert, a manicure, or surgery.  
How to tell a service from a good:  

1. _Services are intangible:_ There is no physical product.  
2. _Services are insperable from the service providers:_ Lawn care, dentistal care, legal advice, are all provided by a person or organization.  
3. _Services are perishable:_ There is no inventory. Prices may change depending on demand (seasonal or otherwise).  
4. _Companies cannot easily standardize services:_ While many service providers attempt to create a consistant experience across many locations (hotels, fast food restaurants), typically every experience is to some extent tailored to the individual (physical therapy, haircut, massage).  

### 11.1b Goods' Services Continuum

The Goods' Services Continuum divides goods and services into three categories:  

* Pure good: A car, a television
* Mixture of good and service: A good meal at a restaurant.
* Pure service: A golf lesson, financial advice.

### 11.1c Closing Example

A-1 has learned that while customers usually approach them looking for a good or a service, most customers need both goods and services. For a particular good, they might inquire if the customer needs training and maintenance services. For a service, they know to learn as much about the job as possible, so that they can offer goods that would be appropriate. A marketing strategy that focuses on goods and services from the start will help them grow to be the primier contractor provider in Los Angeles.  

## 11.2 Types of Consumer Products

"Contrast the three classifications of consumer products in terms of consumer factors and the marketing mix factors."  

### Opening Example

The Oxford Road marketing and consulting firm takes on many clients from many different industrys, both goods and services. There is no single approach to take. How do they go about building the right marketing mix for each?  

### 11.2a Learning It: Types of Consumer Products

A good place to start building a marketing mix is to understand the product. Knowing the buying behaviors for the product helps influence marketing decisions.  

It is common to classify products into one of three groups:  

#### Convenience Products

Goods and services purchased frequently, immediately, and with minimal effort. Example goods: Milk, toothpast, vitamins. Example services: Dry cleaning, car wash.
These can be further subdivided into Impulse goods and services (gum), and staples (bread and butter).  

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

#### Shopping Products

Products purchased after research (price comparison, quality and satisfaction reviews, etc.). Example goods: Cars, houses. Example services: House painter, repair contractor.  
Advertising can raise brand awareness, but personal selling will still be part of the purchase process.  

#### Specialty Prodcuts

These are typically goods and services percieved as high-end. They tend to be expensive, and while the initial purchase may involve comparison and research, these products tend to inspire brand loyalty for future purchases. Example good: Armani, Channel. Example service: Personal financial advisor, elite law firm.  
Such brands are typically, and even intentionally, marketed through limited channels and locations.  

### 11.2b Classifying Consumer Services

Services can be categorized in the same way. Other factors include which market they target (business, consumer, both), and whether they are people or equiptment based (car wash vs. legal aid).  

### 11.2c How the marketing Mix Applies

Not all products fit nicely into one of the three categories, but it should be a useful guide for determining consumer behavior around the product, and the correct marketing mix to use.

### 11.2d Closing Example

Oxford Road's research shows that purchasers of their gum client are shopping at convenience stores and rarely compare prices. Their gum campaign will focus on the low cost of their product.  
Consumers of their TV manufacturer compare price, quality and reputation. They will promote the unique qualities and overall value of the product.  
Consumers spend considerable time researching before making a car purchase. They have chosen to use a sustained personal selling approach.  
And for their tax preperation service, they will promote the different levels of service and the convenience of the online options.  

## 11.3 Types of Business Products

"Identify the six types of business products."  

### Opening Example

Spoke-N-WHeel is a custom dirt-bike manufacturer. They make numerous business purchases. Some are for parts of their products, which they sell and purchase on a regular cadence. Others are for the manufacturing process and are purchased rarely or only once. Understanding the different kinds of business purchases can help determine how often to make them, and who should be doing the purchasing.  

### 11.3a Learning It: Types of Business Products

The classification of business purchases is based on use, not consumer behavior. There are six basic categories.  
* Installations
* Accessory equiptment
* Component parts and materials
* Raw materials
* Supplies
* Business services

#### Installations

These are major capital investments, typically involving numerous decision makers over the course of many months. Price is typically not a major factor. Installations include heavy machinery, customized software, telcom systems, factories.  

#### Accessory Equipment

These are more frequent purchases, and price is a larger factor in the decision. Accessory equipment includes items like cellphones, laptops, furniture.  

#### Component Parts and Materials

These are finished parts from one manufacturer that become part of the product the purchsing business manufactures. These purchases are generally contracted. Computer chips, buttons and switches, power supplies are examples of component parts and materials.  

#### Raw Materials

These are typically natural resources that will require some processing to integrate into the businesses products. These could be metals, grain, wood.  

#### Supplies

Supplies are what a business uses in the course of daily operations. These are routine purchases. Paper, pens, staples, are examples of supplies.  

#### Business Services

Services are intangible proudcts purchsed to facilitate their productions and operations.  Electricity and internet access are examples of business services.  

### 11.3b Closing Example
At Spoke-N-Wheel, members of the product design and product production team are in charge of purchase decisions around installations, accessory equiptment, component parts and materials, and raw materials. The administrative offices are in charge of purchase decisions for supplies and business services.  

## 11.4 Managing Brands for Competitive Advantage

"Summarize the major elements of brand equity."  

### Opening Example

While Nike is one of the largest fitness brands in the world, including the largest woman's fitness brand, other competitors like Lululemon and Athleta have made a mark in the business space with trend-setting avtive and athleisure apparel. Now Nike is increasing it's efforts to maintain and grow in the woman's athletic space. How might it change the way it's percieved to facilitate this move?  

### 11.4a Learning It: Managing Brands for Competitive Advantage

Branding is the process of creating an identity for a product. They are composed of one or more names, terms, signs, symbols, designs. Brands have powerful influence on consumer behavior. Satisfied buyers build brand loyalty and identify with the product and its producer.  

### 11.4b Brand Loyalty

Brand loyalty is measured in three stages:  
* Brand recognition
* Brand preference
* Brand insistence

#### Brand Recognition
Consumers are aware of the brand. Marketers begin promotion by gaining the consumers awareness.  

#### Brand Preference
Previous positive experience with the brand has developed a consumer's preference to the brand over other competitors and generic versions. This is particularly common with clothing, electronics, restaruants.  

#### Brand Insistence
A consumer's affinity for the brand is so strong that they don't want any other. They will seek out the brand they want or go without.  

### 11.4c Brand Equity and Personality

A strong brand identity with superior quality offers strategic advantages for a firm.  

**Brand equity** is the added value a brand gives to a product. High brand equity allows companies to gain larger market shares, and charge higher prices than their competitor.  

Young & Rubicam developed a brand equity system called BrandAsset Valuator. They build brand equity using four dimensions of brand personality:
* _Differentiation:_ The ability to stand out in the minds of consumers.
* _Relevance:_ The real and percived pertinence of the brand to the consumer segment. Consumers need to believe the brand is fulfilling a need.
* _Esteem:_ Consumer perception about a brand and its quality. Positive impressions about a brand raise its esteem, and negative impressions lower it.
* _Knowledge:_ Customers' awareness and understanding of a brand and what it stands for.

### 11.4d Closing Example

Nike hopes to leverage its existing brand equity, while increasing offerings designed for women.  

## 11.5 Protecting Brand Identity

"Differentiate the methods used to develop and protect brand identity."  

### Opening Example

The Philips Company started in the Netherlands in 1891, making lightbulbs. Today they are an enormous technology company. Their brand is associated with innovation, quality, and efficient solutions. This association was created by a consistent and sustained effort over time, and gives them a competitive advantage.  

### 11.5a Learning It: Protecting Brand Identity

An important step in branding is deciding how a brand will be identified in the marketplace.  

#### Brand Names and Brand Marks

A **brand name** is the part of the brand that can be spoken: letters, numbers, words. A **brand mark** is a logo, a symbol or design that identifies the brand, like Nike's swoop.  
Effective brand names convey the brands image. They should be easy to recognize, remember, and pronounce.  

#### Trademarks

Through an approved application to the U.S. Patent office, a company can claim legal exclusive rights to their brand. This is called a **trademark** and can be synonomous with the company name, or other aspects of the brand, like "Coke" for Coca-cola.  

#### Trade Dress

**Trade dress** is the visual cues that differenciate a brand from its competition. It can refer to colors, shapes, packaging. It is the overall image of the brand.  

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

### 11.5b Closing Example

Philips' reputation makes it a successful international company. But it still needs to be recognizable, differenciated from it's competitors, to maintain its competitive edge. To do this, they protect their brand name, brand marks, and trade dress.  

## 11.6 Types of Brand Strategies

"Outline the various types of brand strategies used by marketers."  

### Opening Example

American Pet Nutrition is a successfull pet food company out or Utah, best known for their dog food, "Atta Boy!" They want to capitalize on Atta Boy!'s success and are considering two options. Either they will start Atta Boy! for cats, or Atta Boy! dog treats. How would they best go about choosing which option to pursue?  

### 11.6a Learning It: Types of Brand Strategies

Brands are generally grouped into three categories. Each have their own benefits and drawbacks.   

#### Generic Products

These are sold with little to no advertising, in plain packaging and no brand name. They are affordable, and consumer demand for generics increases during economic downturns. Generic prescriptions do well in any economy.  

#### Manufacturer brands

These are what are typically considered brands, names like Nike, Ford, Panera. Sometimes these are a single product, or a company with a collection of related products. Sometimes a large company might market several different brands.  

#### Private brands

These are store brands like Berkley Jensen and Wellesley Farms (BJ's), or CareOne, Nature's Promise, and Smart Living (Stop & Shop). Often a manufacturer brand is relabled. Some manufacturers won't sell as a private brand to protect their products equity. Most consumers thing private brands are on par with manufacturer brands.  

### 11.6b Brand Extension vs. Line Extension

**Line extension** is a strategy where a successful brand is used for new products. These are typically the same product in different sizes and or packaging, and/or new related products using the same brand.  
**Brand extension** is a strategy where a successful brand is applied to unrelated items, like Dorito taco shells, or Ben and Jerry's cake mix (neither of those things exist as far as I know... maybe the Doritos taco shells do).  

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

### 11.6c Closing Example

Research demonstrated that buyers of Atta Boy! are interested in dog treats from APN. This line extension makes sense and is the decision that APN chose to pursue.  

## 11.7 Organizing Brands and Products

"Explain how companies organize to manage brands and products"  

### Opening Example

Hasbro's VP of Gloabl Brand Strategy and Marketing notes that they have physical toys and games as well as online. They need to make sure that their brands work together across all formats. "Smart toys" are expected to be an $18 billion industry by 2023. Brand managers need to come up with ideas to insure synergies across the different formats.   

### 11.7a Learning It: Organizing Brands and Products

Firms value strong brand equity and assign specific employees with brand development and maintenance. When companies are large and have multiple brand lines they typically assign different employees to different brands.  
A **brand manager** or product manager (titles may vary) is someone who supports the marketing strategy of a given brand. They develop advertising, pricing, promotions, and work with sales representatives. Brand managers may lead new product development prgorams.  
A **category manager** is more appropriate for large manufacturers that sell many brands to large retail sellers. They have similar responsibilities as a brand manager, but to a category of products, rather than a brand. Examples could be dental hygine products, men's toiletries, laundry products.  
Smaller companies might choose to assign a category manager to retail channels instead, like drugstores, supermarkets, convenience stores.  
Large diversified companies might use a mix of the two.  

### 11.7b Organizing for New Product Development

Most companies organize product innovation around one or more of these three categories:  

#### New Product Committees

Sometimes called a venture team, this group brings together a crossfunctional team of experts to develop new product ideas. Members come from marketing, finance, engineering, manufacturing, and research.  

#### New Product Departments

A more prerminent team than a new product committee, the new product department is responsible for all phases of new product development, from ideating to product testing.  

#### Product Managers

A product or brand manager may lead new product development programs, including new product and product improvement recommendations.  

### 11.7c Closing Example

One idea at Hasbro was to track how often children laugh when playing with elmo and trying to turn that into a game. Not at all creepy.  

## 11.8 Three Major Objectives of Packaging

"Summarize the three major objectives of packaging."  

### Opening Example

Heinz Ketchup hasn't changed it's bottle design since 1983. But new technology has introduced cost saving squeeze pouches. They've designed a 10 ounce pouch with pouring spout for half the price of it's 20 ounce bottle. And they've been able to improve on restaruant packets too.  

### 11.8a Learning It: Three Major Objectives of Packaging

The three major objectives of packaging are: Protection against damage, spoilage, and pilferage; assistance in marketing the product; and cost-effectiveness.  

#### Protection against Damage, Spoilage, and Pilferage

Depending on the product, packaging may emphasis one of these three factors over the others, but they are all important. The package should arrive at the consumers home intact, unspoiled, and untampered with.  

#### Assistance in Marketing the Product

This is the trade dress, the colors, logo, symbols, typeface, text, and brand name, presented in a way that helps the consumer find and purchase the product.  

#### Cost-Effectiveness

All of these functions need to happen at a reasonable cost. The cost of packaging impacts the final cost of the product, and the profit from its sale. New shapes and processes can lower the cost of packaging, improving profitability and even lowering consumer costs.  

### 11.8b Labels

Labels are promotional, informational, and functional. The branding can help to promote the product. The product information, like manufacturers address, weight or volume, ingredient list (for foods) provide the consumer with informationl. And UPC codes and SKUs help retailers with pricing and inventory, and integrate with POS systems.  
Some packaging details are legislated by government:  
* _The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act of 1966_: Labels must provide adequate information about it's contents and allow for price comparison with competing products.  
* _The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990_: Nutritional information must be presented in a standard format.  
* _The Food Allergen labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004_:Food labels must disclose major food allergens in a manor that the average consumer can understand. Eight allergens must be identified: Milk, eggs, peoanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat.  

### 11.8c Closing Example

Heinz maintained its iconic branding, but used advertising to communicate that the new product in no way changed the quality of their ketchup. And the new packaging appealed to a younger audience. The lower-cost packaging has been successful.  

### 11.9 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Viking's brand equity helps them to holds onto a 50 percent share of the river cruise market. They differentiate their service, focussing on culture and experiences in the ports of call. And with 70 riverboats allows them to operate at scale and helps to lower the prices of their cruises.
