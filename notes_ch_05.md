### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
LinkedIn is an example of a social media platform that created value for their users and investors. Starting as a simple resume hosting site 10 years ago, they now generate $6.8billion a year from advertising, premium plans, and recruitment services. Recently they've added training services as well. They are now global, with 13,000 employees, and in 24 different languages.  

### 5.1 What Is Social Media?
"Describe the growth and use of social media."  

### Opening Example
Dr. Wagstaff launced a tongue cleaner called Orabrush. But after 10 years he had no increase in sales, selling about three a month. Finally he hired a marketing consultant to create a funny video for YouTube. Using YouTube's Promoted Video Ads service, it received 900,000 views over the next six weeks. And 20% of those viewers clicked through to the Orabrush website. Was this a good use of social media, and should Dr. Wagstaff expect to be selling more tongue brushes as a result of the increased web traffic?  

### 5.1a Learning It: What Is Social Media?
**_Social media_** refers to online communities and communication. Sites like Facebook, Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram  are considered social media sites.  
70% of adults use social media.  
90% of 18-29 year olds use social media, while 40% of people over 65 use social media.  
Spending on social media advertising is expected to be greater than newspapers in the very near future (or possibly already).  

### 5.1b Closing Example
After launching the social media video on YouTube, Orabrush sales incrased to 10,000 units over the next two months. The brand is now available in 25 countries, 30,000 stores, including big names like Walgreens, Target, and CVS, making it the top selling tongue cleaner in the world.  

## 5.2 Social Media Platforms
"Contrast the three major types of social media platforms."  

### Opening Example
Starbucks is an example of an early Social Media adopter. Their famous Pumpkin Spiced Late campaign coordinated customer interaction across multiple platforms, including Pintrest, StumbleUppon, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.  
What advantages does each platform offer marketers?  

### 5.2a Learning It: Social Media Platforms
Different social media platforms have different rules. Most are free to join. Some require an invitation from a member in good standing. Some regulate how you can advertise and interact with your customer base.  

The three basic types of social media platforms are:
#### Social Networking Sites
Facebook, Pinterest, Snapchat, and LinkedIn are examples of _Networking Sites_.  
Members can connect to other members, exchange messages, post thoughts and opinions, and update their statuses.   

Typically, users create a profile with personal information like age, birthday, career, education, with photos and other posted information. A social media platform will usually allow users to search for topics, start communities, and invite friends to join their network.  

#### Social Bookmarking Sites
StumbleUpon, Digg, and Reddit are examples of **_Bookmarking Sites_**. These sites allow users to share links to interesting content elsewhere on the web. People with common interests can find and exchange these links.  
Pinterest incorporates some bookmarking features, allowing users to "pin" content they find interesting, like pictures, recipes, products. Because of their predominantly female membership, they offer marketers a way to connect with that demographic.  

#### Blogging Sites and Forums
Wordpress, Tumblr, and X (formerly Twitter) are examples of **_Blogging Sites and Forums_**. Users can post articles, share content and comments, and interact with one another.  
WordPress is responsible for posting a quarter of the pages on the internet. That's 70 million posts and 77 million comments a month. Many large organizations use Wordpress to host their blogging content.  
Twitter started as a "micro blog" site, but has since lifted the 280 character per post limit. Celebrities use X to communicate with their fans. Businesses and organizations use it to communicate with their consumers and communities. X has incorporated social networking and bookmarking features as well.

### 5.2b Closing Example
"The Real PSL" campaign uses all three types of social media platforms to connect with hundreds of thousands of consumers. It's success has allowed their pumpkin spice latte to successfully sell in 50 countries, selling millions of cups each year.  

## 5.3 How Consumers Use Social Media
"Explain three ways consumers rely on social media to make buying decisions."  

### Opening Example
In the past people learned about cooking at home, helping with nightly meals, from family traditions, then from cooking shows on TV and demonstrations at food or cooking supply stores. But now the internet can share information and recipies, usually through social media platforms like Allrecipes, SparkPeople, and Tastespotting. How does this influence how consumers make purchasing decisions?  

### 5.3a Learing It: How Consumers Use Social Media
91% of consumers visit stores because of an experience they had online. 90% of consumers research products online, more than 67% purchasing the item in-store. Facebook (in 2015) influenced half of on and off line purchases.  
Researching on line is split between social media and search engines, with most consumers using both.  
47% of millinneals are influenced by social media, and 19% of older shoppers.  
Consumers use online communities in three ways:  
1. _Discovering new products (goods and services):_ 28% of people polled by comScore and Group M Search sited YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter as sources of information that helps them discover new brands.
1. _Conducting research and sharing information:_ Blogs and social networking sites provide information and allow feedback and exchanges. 40% of Americans use YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to discuss their healthcare.  
1. _Finalizing purchase decisions:_ 72% of consumers hold online reviews in high regard when deciding on a purchase. They propigate this out by participating in the same sites as they view.  

Marketers need to develop strategies around the way consumers use social media and the internet.  

### 5.3b Closing Example
The Hartman Group found that social media has changed the way Americans think about food, how they eat, plan, cook, and what and where they buy. A marketing strategy around food and food related products should include a social media component.  

## 5.4 Goals of a Social Media Marketing Campaign
"Identify the types of goals marketers use for social media campaigns."  

### Opening Example
Marline and Jim founded PlayToday, an online service to set up playdates for working parents children. They spend all their advertising dollars on an online, social media and search engine campaign, buying promotion spots, improved search ratings, and sponsered ads on Facebook, Pintrest, Google, and Bing. They produced a video for YouTube. But they didn't find the success they were after. What might they have missed?  

### 5.4a Learning It: Goals of a Social Media Marketing Campaign
Social media marketing (SMM) is about starting a conversation around the product, but not necessarily about selling it outright. Marketers need to establish clear objectives for their SMM campaigns. There are generally five types of goals SMM pursues:  

#### Increase Brand Awareness and Generate Leads
Marketers want to introduce their brand, make potential customers aware of their brand, and nurture a relationship with them, hopefully creating a possitive opinion of their brand. They may do this by having onversations with or about their target market using blogs, tweets, news, etc. And they may be able to connect with **influencers** (people who can _influence_ the actions and opinions of others). Example: The Ice Bucket Challenge was a campaign to build awareness of ALS.  

#### Increase Revenue
Conversion rates can be low at first, but the goal is almost always, utlimately, to increase revenue. This is why social media sites can sell advertisments. They can also be used in conjunction with offline marketing efforts.  

#### Improve Customer Service
Social media sites give organizations a forum to represent themselves to their customers, and to respond to their concerns. This could be about quality of service, or other disapointments. And it's faster than print media or other offline solutions.  

#### Manage a Crisis
In the case of harm to an organization's reputation, social media can be used to try to quickly repair that reputation through multiple channels.  

#### Market Research and Customer Feedback
Using a large audience of followers, organizations can solicit ideas and feedback. What would their customers want to see from them? What did they think of the latest thing? Organizations can use their websites, Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, Pinterest pins, email, etc. to interact with, and aquire information from, their target market. And these are almost all people who are already customers.  

### 5.4b Closing Example
Marlene and Jim consulted a professor of marketing at their local college and learned that their campaign was not focused clearly enough. They regrouped and started by bringing brand awareness to their target market. They used Facebook to encourage tips and discussions about parenting, and to introduce their brand to parents. They even brought in a parenting expert to answer questions on their parenting blog. They increased their followers on facebook by 10 fold, quadrupled their Twitter reposts, and hired another expert to handle more and more questions. They succeeded at building awareness and engagement. Now their ready to generate some income.  

## 5.5 Monitoring and Measuring Social Media Marketing
"Describe the various methods for measuring the effectiveness of social media marketing."  

### Opening Example
Promoting a business by posting online, using social media to promote a busines, building a Facebook page with videos and images and links to relevent information is great, but how do you know if it's working?  

### 5.5a Learning It: Monitoring and Measuring Social Media Marketing
Based on the goal of the campaign, select relevent metrics that can be measured throughout the campaign to see the change, if any.  There are three basic categories of measures for this.  
* Measures of activity
* Measures of engagement
* Measures of conversion

#### Measures of Activity
Is the campaign reaching the target market, and are you reaching enough of them?  
* _Total likes/follows/subscribers to the company social media profiles:_ Typically, a larger audience provides a greater opportunity to convert.  
* _New likes/follows/subscribers to the company social media profiles:_ You can measure these to see if there is a significant increase.  
* _Impressions for social media content:_ Counting how many views an image or post gets provides feedback on what captures the audiences attention.  

#### Measures of Engagement
Is the target market engaged with the content?
* _Likes/comments on social media content:_ This can be measured and demostrates how engaged the audience is with the content.  
* _Re-tweets/shares/re-pins:_ This can also be measured and shows that the content in not only engaged with, but has some form of approval. This is especially useful if the shareing was from an influencer.  
* _Click-through rate:_ Links on social media can drive the target market to the organization's website, blog, etc. And that allows the organization a greater control of the messaging experience.  

#### Measures of Conversion
Analytic tools can help show where customers who made purchases came from. This informs future actions on social media.  

A combination of these methods can help improve the content and strategy of the marketing campaign, driving more conversions.  

### 5.5b Closing Example
To determine success, establish what the goal of the campaign is, then use measurements to determine the campaigns impact.  

## 5.6 Creating Effective Social Media Content
"Outline the seven guidelines for creating effective social media content."  

### Opening Example
Weight Wattchers' revenues were flat. Focusing on its "community-centric" approach, they turned to social media to build a community, and partnered with Opra Winfrey, who's motto is "Life is better when you share it." They started their "Better Together" campaign.  

### 5.6a Learning It: Creating Effective Social Media Content
Social Media Marketing is different from print or television in that it is an exchange. Marketers want to engage consumers, disseminate information to them in the form of a conversation, to influence their behavior.   

Effective SM content: 
* _A strong brand focus:_ The content of communications are relevent to the brand. For example, discussing pets is not relevant to weight loss.  
* _A focus on the audience rather than the organization:_ The customer comes first. Conversations can be focused on consumer created content. This is a community. If the brand is about weightloss, highlighting members of the communnity's stories can inspire others and build connections.  
* _Targeted keywords:_ Keywords will draw consumers using search features. Use keywords that will bring those interested in your product. Some sites use hashtags and other means of tagging your content.  
* _Relevant information:_ Instead of simply describing a product, provide relevent information around the category of products. Gardening tools could have tips, discussions, articles, photos, and user stories about successful gardening and solutions to common gardening challenges.  
* _Shareworth text and images:_ Encourage community members to post and share stories, photos, experiences. A gardening brand could use social media to share pictures of the fall harvest, tresseling techniques, giant pumpkins.  
* _Invitations to generate content via posts, shares, discussions, reviews, or other forms of dialog with the organization as well as with fellow customers:_ More of the above.  
* _Promotions that offer discounts, gifts, or other special deals in exchange for participation:_ Post picutres of your garden and win gardening supplies!  

### 5.6b Closing Example
Using Oprah as a spokes person for Weight Watchers drew millions of eyes to their social media campaign and associated her brand with their's. Because of her open struggles with weight loss, she was an excellent spokes person. The campaign resulted in three quarters of revenue growth for Weight watchres.  

## 5.7 Ethics in Social Media
"Summarize three ethical principles for social media marketers."  

### Opening Example
Crocs found a photo of a four year old girl wearing their product and posted it to their website under user content. The parent of the child had no idea until someone contacted her for comment. Should Crocs have asked for permission before posting the content?  

### 5.7a Learning It: Ethics in Social Media
Three principles can help social media marketers protect their brands reputation:
1. Respect privacy
2. Be honest
3. Be accountable

#### Respect Privacy
SMM gathers and holds huge amounts of data about individuals in their target market. If they share this without consent, or through a data breach, it can be expensive, seriously harming their reputation, and could exposing them to fines.  

#### Be Honest
Because of the reach and speed of disemination of information throught the internet, it is extreamly important for marketers to be careful that what they release into the ether is ethical, honest, accurate, and reflective of their brand.  

#### Be Accountable
When mistakes happen, take action to solve or resolve them:  
1. Acknowledge the problem and accept responsiblity.
2. Communicate with those effected through appropriate channels and do what is necessary to make them whole.
3. Follow through with promises, and insure that this kind of mistake wont happen again.  

### 5.7b Closing Example
Crocs acknowledged that, although not illegal, it was inappropriate to share the images of a child without parental permission. They contacted and appologized to the mother, and committed to getting permission before using any user generated content in the future.  

## 5.8 Launching and Measuring a Social Media Campaign
"Given a goal for social media marketing, determine th emost effective method of measurement."  

### Opening Example
When LinkedIn aquired an online learning company called Lynda.com, many didn't see it as a good fit. But LinkedIn executives had a differnt vision and felt they could market Lynda effectively as part of their brand.  

### 5.8 Learning It: Launching and Measuring a Social Media Campaign
The first step in a SSM is identifying the goals of the campaign. Once established, select the right metrics to measure and determine the success of the campaign.

## 5.9 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Lynda.com became LinkedIn Learning. Using data about their users they were able to recomend content and custom curriculums from LinkedIn Learning to individuals and organizations. They also use multiple social media platforms to engage potential customers.
