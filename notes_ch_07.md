### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Multiverse is a made up biofuel manufacturer. Their process solves many of the challenges older biodiesel fuel posed: high cost to produce, excessive wear on engines. Now they need to figure out how to market it. They've chosen organizations with large fleets of vehicales as their target market. Now they need to do some research before they can successfully market their product. What are the questions they need to ask in order to achive their goals?  

## Nature of the Business Market
"Compare the major characteristics of the business market to the consumer market."  

### Opening Example
UPS is the largest package delivery company in the world. They provide B2C and B2B services. For B2B they provide additional services like inventory management and logicistics. Their customers include aerospace, defense, and retailers. To help their business customers they thought they could provide e-commerce web sites and services to them, to make it easier for them to develop a web presence.  
Because different companies face different challenges and have different target markets, UPS had to consider which characteristics they needed in their e-commerce product to make it successful.  

### 7.1 Learning It: Nature of the Business Market
Business markets and consumer markets have different characteristics:  

#### Product
Consumers typically choose from a list of options. Business customers tend to order more technical items, and may need to specify customizations. Business customers also may require services to support their purchase.  

#### Size and Number of Buyers
The business market has fewer buyers, but may buy at much greater volumes. Large enough players, dominating a specific market the way that a few fast food restaurants do, may even have the ability to dictate the price they are willing to pay their suppliers.  

#### Promotion
For most consumer products, advertising is the best way to reach the target market and make sales. For the business market, products are often expensive, and the best means of connecting a product to a purchaser is through a personal relationship. This is true for large consumer purchases too, like a house or a car. But it is more the norm in B2B marketing.  

#### Distribution
B2B distributino channels are usually shorter and more direct.

#### Geographic Market Concentration
Geographically, the business market is more concentrated than the consumer market. Types of businesses, like finance and manufacturing, tend to exist in the same regions as their competition. And their suppliers likewise exist in their customers' regions.  

#### Buyer-Seller Relationships
Especially important in business markets. More complex and enduring than a consumer market relationship, these can lead to millions of dollars in sales, sometimes in a single transaction.  

#### Purchase Decision Process
Businesses have multiple decision makers influencing the ordering process. It is typically far more formal and professional than the consumer purchasing process.

### 7.1b Closing Example
Based on their research, UPS created UPS Ready® Program to create turnkey but customizable, mobile friendly, websites that allow businesses to display products descriptions, inventory, and negotiable terms of sale.  

## 7.2 Categories of Business Markets
"Describe the four categories of business markets."  

### Opening Example
90% of GE's business customers use social media in their decision making process. Knowing this, GE would like to develop a targeted strategy to deliver content about the right product to the right industries. GE makes many products that target different sectors, from lighting to data collection and analysis tools. To market these successfully through social media they must understand the differences in their target markets.  

### 7.2a Learning It: Categories of Business Markets
There are four major categories in the business market:

#### Commercial
This is the largest segment of the business market. This is the market for individuals and organizations that need materials to create other products, from computer chips to bulk chocolate chips, electricity to mops. This includes farmers, manufacturers, contractors, utilities.  
 
#### Reseller
From Office Depot to Home Depot, these are businesses that purchase finsihed products and resell them to the consumer. Sometimes they may further process the product before selling, Like purchasing bulk woodchips, and selling them in 50 pound sacks, or cutting a side of beef into parts.  

#### Government
Federal, state, local, and foreign governments purchase a wide range of goods and services. Typically these are to provide some form of public benefit.  

#### Institutional
This includes hospitals, churches, colleges, museums, non-profits. Some have standardized purchasing procedures, others less so.  

### 7.2b Closing Example
GE implemented a search tool on their page to direct visitors to products based on their interests.  

## 7.3 Segmenting B2B Markets
"Summarize the three major ways marketers segment business markets."  

### Opening Example
Fikes Products is a successfully established janitorial supply company in the Pacific Northwest. As they expand into new territories they need to identify which customers to target. All companies have limited resources to put towards marketing. Deciding which organizations to target is a difficult and important task.  

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

### 7.3a Learning It: Segmenting B2B Markets
Here are three ways to identify market segments:  

#### Demographic Characteristics
In this context, demographic is refering to: sales revenue, number of employees, geographic location, number of products offered.

#### Customer Type
More specific than the four types mentioned in chapter 7.2, these can be grouped by categories like grocery store, restaurant, clothing retailer, etc. **Customer-based segmentation** requires understanding different types of customers and their different needs, which may include product customization. Business to business sellers may choose to develop one or two segments at a time.  

#### End-Use Application
End-use application involves dividing segments by how they use the product. Some businesses may require more or less services, larger or more durable products than others. Sellers can use this information to prioritize marketing efforts.  

### 7.3b Closing Example
Fikes chose to use customer type and end-use application to segment their marketplace. Understanding how each industries used their products and services helped them to target their efforts.  

## 7.4 The Buying Process
"Describe the three major factors that influence purchase decisions in the business market."  

### Opening Example
As the purchaser for MyMap Inc, a GPS device manufacturer for vehicals, looking to upgrade your factory with automated assembley equiptment, you must analyze your needs, define the project goals, develop technical specifications, and come up with a budget.
The suppliers need to understand who the primary decision makers are, and what can influence the purchase, such as low price, fast delivery, high quality, etc.  

### 7.4a Learning It: The Buying Process
THe business _buying_ process, also known as _procurment_, is far more complecated than the consumer buying process. It typically involves multiple parties with individual, as well as organizational, goals. Many things can influence the purchase decision process. A few are:

#### Environmental Factors
This includes economic, political, regulatory, competitive, and technological variables.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

#### Organizational Factors
Organizations differ in how they structure their purchasing process. Some have a central process, others use seperate approaches based on division, location, etc. A business to business seller wants to understand what process is in place to assist in negotiating with the organization.  

#### Interpersonal Influences
Business marketers should make themselves aware of the different people involved in the decision making process for a given organization, and learn what each of their individual priorities are.  

Business marketers should also know the technical features of their product and the needs of the market, and meet with members on multiple levels of the organization. As an example, marketers of medical equiptment make a habbit of visiting hospitals and doctors' offices to discuss their products and build connections with the staff there.  

### 7.4b Closing Example
Marketers need to take into account how conflict between decision makers in an organization, or a change in the economic environment, could influence the purchase process, in order to be in the best position to close a deal.  

## 7.5 The Organizational Buying Process
"List the seven steps in the organizational buying process."  

### Opening Example
King's Hawaiian, maker of King's Hawaiian Sweet Breads, recently expanded and increased it's manufacturying capacity. CEO Mark Taira is excited about the continued success, bu t must respond to rapid changes in consumer demand. Changes have a direct impact on how they manage their buying process.  

### 7.5a Learning It: The Organizational Buying Process
The organizational buing process follows a standard series of steps. Not every step is necessary for every purchase, but it is important to know them.  
1. Anticipate or recognize a problem, need or opportunity
2. Define characteristics and the quantity of a needed good or service
3. Search for and qualify potential suppliers
4. Gather and analyze proposals
5. Evaluate proposals and select supplier(s)
6. Select an order routine
7. Obtain feedback and evaluate performance

#### Step 1: Anticipate or Recognize a Problem, Need or Opportunity
Consumers and Businesses both begin the purchasing process with a need or anticipated need, problem, or opportunity.  

#### Step 2: Define Characteristics and the Quantity of a Needed Good or Service
Business buyers have to translate their problem, need, or opportunity into the specific details of what they can purchase to resolve the need.  

#### Step 3: Search for and Qualify Potential Suppliers
Sometimes there may be only one or a few potential suppliers. But often there are many. The purchasing process needs to evaluate potential suppliers to select the one(s) to so business with.  

#### Step 4: Gather and Analyze Proposals
It isn't uncommon, once it's known that the business is searching for a seller, for them to receive proposals from multiple suppliers. The business will need to analyze these different proposals before selecting a supplier.  

#### Step 5: Evaluate Proposals and Select Supplier(s)
Factors to consider include price, but also relationship factors like communication and trust (who do you want to do business with?), reliability, time from order to delivery, quality of product, history of order accuracy. Different businesses will chose different factors to consider based on their individual needs.  

#### Step 6: Select an order routine
Agree upon how orders will be placed in the future. This could mean cadence, physical format of a purchase order, means by which orders are communicated, delivery terms, and payment terms.  

#### Step 7: Obtain Feedback and Evaluate Performance
Organizations will want to review and evaluate their suppliers. Larger organizations typically have a formal process for this.  

### 7.5b Closing Example
By anticipating the change in consumer demand, King's Hawaiian should continue to be successful.  

## 7.6 Buying Center Roles
"Outline the five roles within the buing center."  

### Opening Example
Toysmith is a toy company. They came up with an idea for colorful putty that could be used to decorate snowmen. The idea is that the putty hardens and doesn't melt with the snowman. Instead the different decorations remain solid, and only the snow melts away. And it melts away without leaving a messy stain!
To sell this, Toysmith needs to identify who at each retailer needs the most convincing. Walmart is especially important, because they have such a large market share.
How do they identify the right decision makers for their "melting snowman" toy?  

### 7.6a Learning It: Buying Center Roles
A company's **buying center** is an _informal_ group composed of everyone that has input on the buying process. Typically there are five main roles:

#### Users
These are people who will use the product being marketed. Sometimes, with products like new computers, company phones, mops, toilet paper, these people are internal to the organization. Other times they are customers of the organization. In this latter case, the marketer must understand what motivates the target market, so as to convince the members of the buying center that their product will sell.  

#### Influencers
These people may establish buying specifications, or supply information that guides evaluation of the product and its alternatives.  

#### Gatekeepers
These people control information that the buying center will review. They may choose which print information gets distributed, or which sales person can speak to members of the staff. In large organizations like Walmart, buyers have assistants that play this role. It's in the interest of marketers to develop relationships with the gatekeepers.  

#### Buyers
These are the people who officially select suppliers and secure the purchase.  

#### Deciders
Often the same as the buyer, these are the people that choose what will be purchased. Sometimes, however, they may be someone else, like someone in authority that makes the final approval, or a technical person whos recomendation is highly regarded.  

Determining who the buying center is composed of, and reaching those individuals, is a difficult challenge. The official purchasers may not have as much authority to select a supplier as other members of the organization who's position is seemingly unrelated.  

### 7.6b Closing Example
Because of their history of success, and relationship with their retailers, Toysmith was generally trusted, and knew who the decision makers were. The Melting Snowman made it onto the shelves, and into the homes of children that enjoyed the product and came back for more.  

## 7.7 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Multivers focused making fewer, larger sales to a business market. They identified government and institutional buyers, and segmented these markets by choosing those that purchased over $1 million a year, and/or had fleets of over 50 vehicals.  
The greatest challenge is identifying the decision makers in each organization. They do have extensive experience in business and are in a good position to succeed.
