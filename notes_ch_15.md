### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Miniboss is a hypothetical company that manufactures custom clothes for toddlers. They control all steps from gathering raw materials to design and production. After receiving a custom order they manufacture and ship the clothing witin seven days, using UPS express shipping.  

Their flagship line, TopToddler, is winning awards. The company continues to grow. They have decisions to make about this growth. Miniboss wants to maximize efficiency along its distribution channels and supply chain. Should they partner with a distribution company, or negotiate a contract with UPS or another carrier?   

## 15.1 What Are the Four Distribution Channels?

"Describe the four types of distribution channels."  

### Opening Example

Procter & Gamble produces hundreds of products across multiple product categories. Brands include Bounty paper towels and Crest toothpaste. They have millions of dollars to spend on marketing. As a marketing manager for P&G's hair care category (products like Head & Shoulders and Pantene) you have been tasked to allocate $20 million to different istribution channels, to connect these hair care brands with consumers. Which channels are available, and which would be most effective?  

### 15.1a Learning It: What Are the Four Distribution Channels?

Even the best product would fail without a plan that makes it available in the right place, at the right time, to the right consumers. Distribution channels (aka marketing channels) are made of individuals and organizations managing the flow of products from producers to consumers. Firms must consider consumer needs,analyze the different types of channels, and determine the most appropriate channels for their goods and services.   

<div class="pagebreak">

### 15.1b Types of Distribution Channels

Choosing a distribution channel starts with determining the seller's objectives and the distribution needs of customers. There are four types of channels to choose from:

* Direct channel
* Channels using marketing intermediaries
* Dual distribution
* Reverse channels

#### Direct Channel

This is the simplest and shortest channel. The producer sells directly to the consumer. **Direct selling** is a useful tactect for direct channel distributers. It involves connecting directly with the consumer. It is particularly useful for items that may require more convincing. Multiple channels can exist in direct channel distribution. For example, a small business might sell through their website, but also have a brick and mortar location.  

#### Channels Using Marketing Intermediaries

Direct channels are a simple way to distribute goods, but are not ideal for some scenerios. Goods that require repeat purchases, sometimes frequent repeat purchases, products serving markets in different areas of the world, products with large numbers of potential end users, can all benefit from _marketing intermediaries_. Marketing intermediaries (aka middlemen) are individuals and organizations with established means of connecting producers to consumers. There are three priamry types: **retailers**, **wholesalers**, and **agents**.  

Retailers open stores, hire sales staff, produce marketing to generate consumer traffic, and display merchanise in ways that encourage consumers to purchase them.  

Wholesalers (aka distributors) purchase goods, store them in warehouses, and distribute them to retailers, other distributers, and consumers.  

Sales agents are particulary useful for smaller firms or firms going into new markets. They are contracted sales professionals with expertise in their markets or geography, and they act as go-betweens, connecting producers with distribution partners.  

Typical distribution channels are:

* Producer to retailer to consumer
* Producer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer
* Producer to agent to wholesaler to retailer to consumer

**Vertical integration** is when a producer takes control over functions, like sourcing raw materials and distributing final products, that typically were previously handled by third parties.  

#### Dual Distribution

Dual distribution is the movement of products to consumers through more than one channel. An example would be using a website for direct distribution, retailers as domestic distribution channels, and agents for international distribution channels. Dual distribution strategies can increase coverage in the market place, and reduce distribution costs.  

#### Reverse Channels

Reverse channels are used to return items to the producer from the consumer. This could be a recall, a return, or a recycling opportunity. An example could be Apple giving a discount on a new purchase with the trade in of an old phone.  

### 15.1c Closing Example

P&G marketers might try a dual channel approach to marketing P&G hair products, funding in store promotions, but also using social media to drive business to the P&G website for direct purchases.  

## 15.2 Functions of Intermediaries

""Describe the three functions of marketing intermediaries."  

### Opening Example

Unified Grocers is the largest retailer-owned wholesale grocery cooperative in the western United States. It has unveiled a new addition to it's private label, to appeal to the growing consumer perference for natural and organic products. These will be marketed under the brand Natural Directions. To do so, it will work with multiple intermediaries in multiple distribution channels, coordinating with suppliers and retailers. Why don't they just sell directly to customers and cut out the additional intermediaries? Which intermediaries ar most important to Unified Grocers and its Natural Direction brand.  

### 15.2a Learning It: Functions of Intermediaries

Intermediaries can often perform distribution functions more effectively and efficiently than producers. The right intermediaries can result in more sales and profit for the producer. Three important functions that intermediaries perform are:  

* Facilitate the Exchange Process
* Lower Cost of Logistics
* Increase Sales and Marketing Infrastructure

#### Facilitate the Exchange Process

Intermediaries hold relationships with customers, retailers, and wholesalers, lowering the cost a producer would encure to maintain the same. This allows producers to reach a greater number of customers at a lower cost.  

#### Lower Cost of Logistics

Intermediaries can provide infrastructure like warehouses and delivery vehicals, making distribution more affordable.  

<div class="pagebreak">

#### Increase Sales and Marketing Infrastructure

Intermediaries can perform marketing services on behaf of the producers.

### 15.2b Short and Long Distribution Channels

A short distribution channel involves few intermediaries. Long distribution channels involve several intermediaries. Business market products typically move through short channels because of geographic concentrations and fewwer purchases. Services also have short channels because of the inseperability from the provider.  

### 15.2c Closing Example

Using intermediaries allows Unified Grocers to distribute their Natural Directions brand to more locations and consumers than they would be able to do on their own.  

## 15.3 Selecting Distribution Channels

"Outline the five factors that influence selection of distribution channels."  

### Opening Example

What factors would be most influencial in choosing distribution channels for a marketing manager at Keen Footwear, a made in the USA footwear, bags, and sock company based in Portland Oregon?  

### 15.3a Learning It: Selecting Distribution Channels

Several strategic decisions have to be made when choosing distribution channels. Marketers must consider what characteristics of a retailer make it the best channel option? How many intermediaries should be used? Why might they want to use more than one channel?  

A number of factors affect the selection of a distribution channel, including:  

* Market factors
* Product factors
* Organizational factors
* Competitive factors
* Intensity factors

#### Market Factors

Businesses prefer to purchase products directly from the producer, with the exception of supplies and some accessories. Consumers purchase almost all of their products through retailers. Marketers may sell products to businesses and consumers through seperate channels.  

Needs, geographic location, and average order size also affect channel choice. For concentrated markets with a small number of buyers, direct marketing channels are a feasible choice. For geographically scattered areas, distribution through intermediaries may make more sense.  

<div class="pagebreak">

#### Product Factors

Perishable products favor short distribution channels so that they arrive unspoiled. Less or unperishable items like canned goods or bar soap favor longer channels to reach the widest distribution and largest number of buyers possible.  

#### Organizational Factors

Large organizations with strong financial, managerial, and marketing resources may prefer to take a vertical approach, using their own workforce, warehouses, distribution vehicals, and sales teams to market directly to retailers or customers.  

Smaller organizations without the resorces to warehouse and distribute their products widely benefit from using intermediaries.  

#### Competitive Factors

Companies may choose distribution channels to compete head to head with their competition, others might choose channels that offer them exclusivity.  

When exploring new distribution channels, it is important to avoid upsetting existing channels. For distribution channels to be efficient, all parties must work cooperatively. Two types of conflict can hider normal functioning of distribution lines:  

_Horizontal conflict_ is when two or more channel members at the same level have conflict. For example, a retailer used to exclusivity for a given product may be upset when that exclusivity goes away and their competition can now supply the same product. This could lead to competitive pricing and disrupt profits.  

_Vertical conflict_ is when two or more channel members at different levels have conflict. For example, a retailer may come out with its own private brand that competes with producers' brands. A producer might establish their own retail shop, or add an online direct to consumer channel that competes with the retailer.  

Channel conflict is avoided when all members of a distribution channel cooperate. Firms have to find ways to handle both offline and online chanels without damaging relationships.  

#### Intensity Factors

_Distribution intensity_ is the number of intermediaries (typically retailers) the manufacture istributes its goods through in a given market. Optimal distribution intensity ensures adequate market coverage for a given product. This varies based on the goals of the manufacturer, the type of product, and the consumer segments of the target market. There are three basic categories of distribution intensity:  

_Intensive Distribution:_ This strategy wants to distirbute through all available retailers in the trade area. This strategy suits products (like a candy bar) with wide appeal across a broad group of consumers.  

_Selective Distribution:_ This strategy wants to limit the number of retailers in the market area that can distribute the product. This is a good fit for brands that want to maintain control of marketing while reducing costs. It allows the manufacturer to develop stronger relationships with the members of the channel and protect the company brand.  

_Exclusive Distribution:_ This strategy wants to limit the number of retailers even more. A producer might grant exclusive rights to one retailer in a given market area. This may result in loss of market coverage, but will work well with products using a prestige pricing strategy. Producers and retailers cooperate closely with pricing, marketing, and inventory.  

One _fundamental principle_ in choosing distribution channels, a member of the channel must perform a central function more efficiently or affordably than the producer.  

### 15.3b Closing Example

Marketers at Keen Footwear considered multiple factors to choose their distribution strategy.

**Market factors:** The channel needs to reach the target market.  
**Product factors:** The product is durrable, so long channels are not out of the question.  
**Organizational factors:** The company has limited resources. Direct marketing is limited to online.  
**Competitive factors:** Good product differenciation means channels that also deal with competing brands is not a problem.  
**Intensity factors:** Protecting brand is important to Keen. They should use a selective distribution channel to reach a large group of consumers, but also maintain control over how their products are priced, displayed, and sold.  

## 15.4 Components of the Supply Chain

"List the key priorities for each cunction of the manufacturing supply chain."  

### Opening Example

Kirkland's is a home decor retailer. It buys a mix of items from about 200 vendors. An efficient supply chain is critical to their success. If seasonal or high-demand items arrive late to its distirbution center, or insufficient quantities are shipped, they may miss opportunities to deliver choices to their 400+ retail stores. And that could cause them to loose ground to competitors.  

What are some components Kirkland's needs to consider in its supply chain?  

<div class="pagebreak">

### 15.4a Learning It: Components of the Supply Chain

The supply chain, also known as the _value chain_ is the complete sequence of suppliers and activities that encompase the creation and delivery of goods and services. It includes the sourcing of raw materials, the conversion of these materials into products, their storage, the sale of the product to the consumer, and the delivery mechanisms and other logistics throughout.  

**Upstream management** refers to the activites leading to the creation of the product:  

* Raw materials
  * Quality
  * Availability
  * Ethical sourcing
* Inbound Logistics
  * Timeliness
  * Reliability
* Warehouse and Storage
  * Safety
  * Security
  * Inventory control

**Production** includes the activities around creating the product:  

* Quality Control
* Safety
* Fair labor practices
* Speed
* Cost

**Downstream Management** encompasses ativities after the product is created, until it is delivered to the consumer:  

* Finished Product Storage
  * Safety
  * Security
  * Inventory control
* Outbound Logistics
  * Timeliness
  * Reliability
* Marketing and Sales
  * Brand consistancey
  * Targeted effort
* Customer Service
  * Accessability
  * Streamlined return process

Not all parts of downstream management are part of the distribution channel. An example is a product that is sold over the internet. The sale is part of direct distribution. However the delivery of the product by a third party like UPS, while part of the outbound logistics, would not be considered part of the distribution channel.  

Businesses must look for ways to optimize the function of each activity in the supply chain.  

### 15.4b Managing the Supply Chain

Common methods of streamlining and managing logistics and the supply chain as part of a distribution strategy:  

_Radio Frequency Identification:_ RFID chips are placed on items, making them electronically trackable. This is the same technology used in employee ID badges and highway toll transponders.  

_Enterprise Resource Planning:_ An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an integrated software package that consolidates data from a businesses units. They can help solve challenges around sequencing and scheduling.  

_Logistical Cost Control:_ To reduce logistical costs, businesses must regularly reexamine all links in their supply chain to identify and remove, reduce, or redesign activites that do not add value. Some activity costs may be reduce through outsourcing.  

### 15.4c Closing Example

Kirkland's success can be attributed to its meticulously organized supply chain. Coordination of its supplier network, logistic processes, and inventory control are essencial to this, and allow them to generate strong proffits by delivering products an the right time and place.  

## 15.5 Key Priorities of Warehousing and Storage

"Summarize methods for managing the warehousing and storage function of the supply chain."  

### Opening Example

Lenka's Fresh Snacks (LFS) is a granola bar manufacturer in Yoe, Pennsilvania. They have 450 retail partners and manufacture them in a 4,000 sqft facility. As they expand, they decide to add chia seeds and almonds to products in their line. These products have different order quantities and storage requirements than their current materials. What are some priorities they should consider around warehousing and storage?  

### 15.5a Learning It: Key Priorities of Warehousing and Storage

There are three major elements to wharehouse and storage functions:  

* _Inventory control:_ quantity of inventory maintained at each location
* _Protective packaging and materials handling:_ how to package and efficiently handle goods in the factory, warehouse, and transportation terminals
* _Warehousing:_ the distribution system's location of stock, and the number of locations maintained

#### Inventory Control

Companies need to maintain enough inventory to meet customer demand without the costs of carrying excess inventory. Just in time (JIT) production can be an effective way to reduce storage costs, but relies on precise demand forcasting, and on the suppliers ability to reliably deliver on time.  

#### Protective Packaging and Materials Handling

Materials handling is the storage and moving of materials within factories, warehouses and transportation termainals. Two important concepts influencing choices in the materials handling system are:  

_Unitizing:_ Also known as palletizing, the idea is to combine as many packages as possible into each load that is moved. This efficiency is done to minimize the labor required. Securing materials together can also help to minimize damage and pilfering.  
_Containerization:_ This extends the idea of unitizing by combining several unitized loads into a singe load. Containerization reduces the time required to load and unload ships and limits in-transit damage.  

#### Warehousing

There are two types of warehouses:  

_Storage Warehouse:_ holds goods for moderate to long periods, balencing supply and demand for producer and purchaser.  
_Distribution Warehouse:_ assembles and redistributes goods, keeping them moving. It is not uncommon for a distribution warehouse to house a good for less than 24 hours before sending them on to the customers.  

Shipping large, consolodated loads to distribution warehouses known as break-bulk centers, where they are broken down and repackaged to fulfill customer orders, lowers transportation costs.  

Automation, although expensive up front, can also lower costs.  

Two categories influencing decisions on the number and location of warehouses are:  

* Warehousing and material handling costs
* Delivery costs from warehouses to customers

### 15.5b Closing Example

Adding a new flavor requires LFS to reexamine its warehousing and storage functions.  

To adjust to the new flavor ingredients, LFS has implemented JIT manufacturing, and sends demand forecast to its suppliers so that they can deliver the right materials at the right time. They also implemented palletizing, to make moving materials around the facility faster, easier, and cheaper. This approach has also saved LFS the cost of having to buy or build another warehouse.  

## 15.6 Modes of Transportation

"Compare the five major modes of transportation"  

### Opening Example

Mark Guilfoil is VP of supply management at the USPS. To save taxpayer dollars, Guilfoil must optimize transportation costs for mail and package deliveries. And to stay competitive with private delivery service providers like UPS and FedEx, he is expected to maintain or increase the quality of the USPS. What are some avaiable options and how should he evaluate which to use?  

### 15.6a Learning It: Modes of Transportation

_**Ton-mile**_ refers to the activity requird to move one ton of freight one mile.  

Each of the five major modes of transportation has it's own unique characteristics:  

#### Railroads

Railroads are the most efficient way to move bulky commodities over long distances.

#### Motor Carriers

Trucking reaches areas trains can't. It is relatively fast and consistent for both large and small shipments. And technology has improved efficiency, with satellite tracking and in-truck computer systems that allow dispatchers and drivers to make last-minute changes in delviery schedules.  

#### Water Carriers

There are two categories of water carrier: inland or barge lines, and oceangoing deepwater ships.  

_Barge lines_ are efficient at transporting goods through inland waterways. A barge line can stretch a quarter mile or more.  
_Oceangoing deepwater ships_ are massive container ships that can move large amounts of goods across oceans. They are somewhat slow, but very affordable.  

#### Pipelines

Pipelines are limited to a few number of products. Liquids, typically fuel are transported this way. They are considered low maintenance, but service fewer locations than inland waterways. Although they are third in terms of ton-miles, they are considered slow, moving liquids at an average speed of 3 miles per hour.  

#### Air Freight

Moving the fewest ton-miles, air freight does offers a number of advantages. It can deliver to hard to reach and remote locations, is faster for time sensitive material, and is an easy way to participate in international trade. It also has a high level of security.  

### 15.6b Comparing the Five Modes of Transport


Examples of types of goods typically handled by different modes of transportation:  

* _Railroads:_ lumber, iron, steel, coal, automobiles, grain, and chemicals, plus containeraized loads of finished products.
* _Motor carriers:_ clothing, furniture, fixtures, lumber, plastic, food, leather, and machinery
* _Water carriers:_ fuel, oil, coal, chemicals, minerals, and petroleum products; automobiles, electronics, clothing, and toys from foreign manufacturers
* _Pipelines:_ oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, and natural gas
* _Air freight:_ flowers, medical testing kits, and gourmet food products sent directly to consumers

#### Intermodal Operations

_Intermodal operations_ use a combination of transport modes to improve customer service and achieve cost advantages.  

### 15.6c Closing Example

The USPS already uses sophisticated intermodal transports. Mark Guilfoil has many options to optimize the supply chain. For example, monitoring fuel costs could cause changes in choices, switching between motor carriers and rail carriers to use the more cost effective method. Packages above a given value might take advantage of the higher level of security that air transport provides. 

## 15.7 Accomplishing the Priorities of a Supply Chain

"Given an example of a supply chain, identify methods for accomplishing the priorities of that supply chain."  

Miniboss has a strategic plan for growth, has prepped its supply chain for expansion of the TopToddler line, and has identified suppliers that can handle the projected volume. Their manufacturing facility can handle up to five times the current demand. And they've identified additional opportunities to make manufacturing, distribution, and transportation more efficient and less expensive. The goal is to have the right product at the right time, while cutting logistics costs.  

### 15.7a Learning It: Accomplishing the Priorities of a Supply Chain

Tightly managing supply chains lowers costs and improves customer service. MiniBoss has identified that 70% of purchases are of one of three items. They plan to anticipate demand, manufacture these items before they are ordered, ship them via truck to warehouses operated by intermediaries, and let the intermediaries fulfill local orders.  

The improved supply chain will make it less likely that they will miss out on orders because they are not in stock. Shipping costs will be reduced by using motor freight instead of air freight. And those savings will allow them to pay for the intermediaries to store, warehouse, and deliver their products, reducing their delivery time from time of order, from seven days to two. And that will improve their image in the market.  

### 15.8 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

 Supply chains are complicated. Supply chain management requires coordinating efficient and conflict-free distribution channels, integration of internal systems with partner's systems, and other strategic steps. It requires constant monitoring and fine tuning. Careful consideratino of supply chain and distribution channels allow marketer to delvier products to the right place at the right time.
