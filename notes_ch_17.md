### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Pepe's pizza's promotional efforts show how using advertising, salse promotion, and public relations together can make for a powerful promotional mix. They use word of mouth, charitable giving, social media, press releases, advertising, and some direct-mail to communicate their new openings. And their charitable giving generates positive public relations.  

## 17.1 Integrated Marketing Communication

"Identify the five components of the promotional mix."  

### Opening Example

The director of advertising for a cereal company has decided to spend advertising money on product placement in a popular Netflix comedy. How does he explain this to the boss?  

### 17.1a Learning It: Integrated Marketing Communication

Integrated Marketing Communication is the effort marketers use to create a unified product identity/personality through multiple parts of the promotional mix, all targeting their target market.

### 17.1b Elements of the Promotion Mix

Promotional mix is a blend of variables designed to meet the needs of a company's customers and the organizations objectives. The five components of the promotional mix are:  

* Advertising
* Personal selling
* Sales promotion
* Direct marketing
* Public relations

#### Advertising

Paid, non-personal communication through media: television, radio, magazines, online. Goods and services targeting large audiences are particularly appropriate for advertising. Advertising is augmented by product placement and sponsorship.  
_Product placement_ is paying to have products displayed in movies and TV.  
_Sponsorship_ is the supporting of an event or activity, either with cash or other resources. This could include naming rights on a stadium, or a charity event.  

#### Personal Selling

_Personal selling_ is a person-to-person promotional presentation. This includes one on one, or presentation to an audience. Time shares, home renovations, real estate are examples where personal selling is employed.  

#### Sales Promotion

_Sales promotion_ is marketing short durratino incentives, usually in combinaiton with other components of the promotion mix, to support promotional objectives. This could include coupons, contensts, samples, product demos, displays, and discounts.  

#### Direct Marketing

_Direct marketing_ is the use of communication to generate a response, like an order or a lead. This could be an infomercial, an advertisment. It includes direct-response advertising, seeking an immediate response.  

#### Public Relations

_Public relations_ are an organization's communication and relationships with stakeholders. Stakeholders include customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees, government, and the public. The marketing aspect of this is called _publicity_. Marketers seek unpaid placement of news about the company and/or its products. Consumers often find this information more authentic than other forms of marketing. The cost for this type of marketing is low, but so is control of the message.  

### 17.1c Variants of the Promotion Mix

_Guerrilla marketing_ is using unconventional, innovative, low cost techniques to gain attention. An example could be hiring street artists to paint or otherwise dispaly the company logo on billboards, blank walls, etc. Using students as "campus ambassadors" is sometimes called _buzz marketing_. Students are paid to generate interest and coversation around a product. They may wear or distribute swag as well. Viral marketing is another example of guerrilla marketing.  

### 17.1d Closing Example

Product placement is not a substitute for advertising. It is a form of advertising, and supports traditional advertising campaigns. It is considered highly effective and reaches a large number of the target market.  

## 17.2 The Communication Process

"Explaoin how the communication process relates to the AIDA concept."  

### Opening Example

Jeans By Jeremy used advertisments in Glamour, Allure, and Cosmopolitan to market clothing to professional women in their 20s and 30s. The chain has been greatly successful. When expanding to a line for teenage girls they used the same advertisment channels, but the response by teens was nearly nonexistent. Why?  

### 17.2a Learning It: The Communication Process

Getting their message clearly and persuasively to the right audience. An effective message accomplishes three tasks:  

1. It gains the receivers attention.
2. It achives understanding by both receiver and sender.
3. It stimulates the receiver's needs and suggests an appropriate method of satisfying them.

### 17.2b The AIDA Concept

The AIDA concept (attention, interest, desire, action) are thesteps the consumer takes in reaching a purchase decision.

&nbsp;

First, _encoding_ is the process of translating the message into understandable terms through a _communication channel_. The receiver's _response_ provides _feedback_ to the marketers. Throughout this process there is _noise_: ineffective promotional appeals, inappropriate advertising media, poor radio or television reception. Noise interferes with the transmition of the message, reducing its effectiveness.  

The marketer is the message sender. They encode the message in presentations, advertising, displays, or publicity releases. The channel may be a person, publication, advertising, or website. Decoding is done by the receiver, and the receiver will do so based on their own frame of references. It is important that the encoder understand their target market's frame of references to effectively encode the message.  

Feedback allows the marketers to hone their encoding of the message.  

noise can come from a variety of disruptions. Competing promotional messages over the same channel, misinterpretation of the sales presentation, the use of industry jargon that consumers find hard to understand, random events, and leaving the room durring television commercials are all examples of noise.  

### 17.2c Closing Example

Inappropriate media placement is an example of noise, an interference with the encoding, decoding, or feedback part or the marketing process. Jeans By Jeremy needs to advertise where their target market is, publications like Teen Vogue and Seventeen might get better results.  

## 17.3 The Objectives of Promotion

"Describe the various objectives of promotion."  

### Opening Example

Initially, Special Sweets, an organic chocolate store, planned to use billboards to get their name known. The marketers realized they also need a plan to stimulate demand, and sales promotion to encourage trial and retain loyal customers.  

### 17.3a Learning It: The Objectives of Promotion

Promotion's purpose is to inform, persuade, and influence consumer purchase decision making. Common promotional objectives are:  

* Create Awareness
* Stimulate Demand
* Encourage Product Trial
* Retain Loyal Customers

#### Create Awareness

For introductory stage products, customers nead to know that the product exists. Rapid accomplishemnt is critical to recouping the costs of development and production. Growth and mature stage products also need awareness, for example, of new features, to new markets, or to improve their image.  

#### Stimulate Demand

Building _selective demand_ for a product is accomplished by differenciating the product from its competiors. Building _primary demand_ is accomplished by introducing potential buyers to a new category of products that they were not familiar with.  

#### Encourage Product Trial

Incentivise the customer by reducing risk and making the purchase easy. Giving out coupons, samples, or free trials of a product are examples of how a marketer can help familiarize the consumer with the product or brand.

#### Retain Loyal Customers

Finding new customers is more difficult and expensive than retaining existing ones. Frequent-buyer or reward programs like airline miles and reward cards where the tenth purchase is free can help. Advertising can also reassure existing customers that their choice of purchasing a product was sound.  

### 17.3b Closing Example

Special Sweets needs a multidimentional approach to promoting their goods. Billboards to get their name out, radio adds to educate the consumer on the benefits of thier product category. Free samples to get people to taste their sweets, and a Celebration Club that sends out coupons for birthdays and special events.  

## 17.4 Advertising Appeals

"Describe the types of appeals used by advertisers."  

### Opening Example

Don Draper said, "Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And do you know what happiness is? It's freedom from fear." A 2015 TV commercial for Nationwide Insurance featured a young boy talking about all the things he missed after dying in a car crash. That commercial was unsuccessful and taken off the air. Why?  

### 17.4a Learning It: Advertising Appeals

Marketers work to create appeals that stand out and is less likely of being skipped by consumers.  

Ads are typically created as part of an _advertising campaign_, a series of related ads with a single theme appearing in different media for a specific time frame. Advertisers balance tone, information, and conclusions with the ad's story
and its emphasis on verbal or visual elements.  

Marketers choose between focus on the practical like price and performance, or evoking emotional responses with fear, humor, or sex. Would a celebrity endorsement help? Should the ad compare their brand to their competition?  

#### Fear Appeals

Fear appeals focus on bad outcomes for consumers that don't choose the product advertised. Allstate's "Mayhem" character is a good example of this.  

Fear appeals can backfire if the viewer perceives the advertisment as too aggregious or unpleasant to watch.  

#### Humor in Advertising Messages

Marketers may use humor to evoke and associate positive emotions with their product or brand. However, humor is subjective, so knowing the target-audience is important. Some find humorous ads contraversal, thinking that the consumer may like the add, but fail to learn about, or even remember what is, the product.  

#### Ads Based on Sex

Sex based appeals attract attention immediately. Lingerie and sexy models wearing the marketer's clothing create a strong response. Depending on the culture this response could be positive, or very negative.  

#### Celebrity Testimonials

Celebrities in ads can help by "cutting through the clutter." Celebrity endorsements are very popular in some countries. Studies show celebrities improve product recall, believability, and brand recognition.  

Celebrities that endorse too many products may confuse the public and weaken their effectiveness. Problems also arise if the celebrity's image is tarnished or they are deemed not credible.  

One way to avoid the down-side of celebrity endorsement is by creating their own charectors, like Flo, or even cartoons like the GEICO gecko. Cartoons can't get involved in scandals.  

#### Comparative Advertising

When the product is not a leader in its market, advertisers may choose _comparative advertising_, to emphasize advertising with comparisons to dominant brands. Market leaders rarely mention competitors, as it would only advantage the competitor to do so.  

### 17.4b Closing Example

The Nationwide add was considered by consumers to be over the top. It was percieved as insensitive and depressing. The result of this ad was so strong that the CEO was forced to resign.  

## 17.5 Media Selection and Scheduling

"Compare the seven different advertising media."  

### Opening Example

After the BP oil rig spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP attempted to respond to the public outrage through television ads focusing on their commitment to repairing the damage to the environment and the local economy. Why did they choose the more expensive medium of TV?  

### 17.5a Learning It: Media Selection and Scheduling

The objective of _media selection_ is to achieve adequate advertising coverage without going beyond the identifiable limits of the target market. Researchers identify the characteristics of the market segment, then marketers match that to what they find to be the most appropriate forms of media.

&nbsp;

#### Television

40 cents of every dollar spent on advertising is spend on television. It allows national companies, as well as regional, to reach local markets. Cable allows finer tuning to target markets, called _narowcasting_, through its many specialized channels.  

Television offers many advantages:  

* Mass coverage
* Strong, visual impact
* Repetition of message
* Flexibility
* Prestige

Disadvantages include:  

* High costs
* Easily forgetable
* DVR viewers may skip content

#### Radio

Traditional radio is great for reaching local markets. Individual stations allow marketers to narrow efforts to those aligned with the target market. And it is now augmented with online podcasting, allowing more listening options.  

Advantages:  

* Low cost
* Targeted markets
* Flexability
* Mobility

Disadvantages:  

* Distracted listeners
* Lack of visual imagery

#### Newspapers

Although in decline, newspapers provide many useful characteristics for advertisers:  

* Ability to reach local markets
* Flexibility of advertising between localities
* Able to refer back to the printed media

Disadvantages:  

* Many adds on the page create "noise"
* Print quality

#### Magazines

_AARP The Magazine_ is the most widely distributed magazine in the U.S. Marketers can use other criteria than distribution as well. Magazines provide well targeted audiences. Other advantages:  

* Long life
* Quality of images and print quality

Disadvantages:  

* Long lead time
* High cost

#### Direct mail

This includes sales letters, postcards, leaflets, folders, booklets, catalogs. It's extremely good at segmenting markets.  

Advantages:  

* Market segmentation
* Speedy lead time
* Personalizatoin

Disadvanges:  

* Higher costs
* Reliance on quality mailing lists
* May be treated as "junk mail"

#### Outdoor Advertising

Billboards, murals, digital displays, images in and on cabs, busses and trains are exaples of outdoor advertising. Becuase of the public nature of outdoor advertising, regulations exsist regarding what can appear in this media. Outdoor advertising tends to be simple images or short phrases. Humor is often used.  

Advantages:  

* Quick communication of simple ideas
* Great for local products

Disadvantages:  

* Regulations
* Short visual experience
* Clutter

#### Digital Media

This is a rapidly growing sector. There are many options to fit most budgets. Digital marketing allows for interactive marketing. It can be highly targeted. On the down side, click through costs can be high.  

### 17.5b Closing Example

BP used Televition inorder to reach the largest audience. Its deep pockets meant the high cost was not a deterent. They ran these ads for months to insure adequate repetition. And they believe it helped to restore customer loyalty.  

## 17.6 Public Relations

"Describe the roles of public relations, publicity, and cross-promotion in an organization's promotion strategy."  

### Opening Example

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)has called for a ban on fast-food advertising durring children's programming, siteing it as a primary cause in the increase of childhood obesity. Fast food marketers like MacDonald's have pushed back, pointing to healthy choices added to their menu, and emphasising that it's perfectly legal to advertise to children. These companies are at a disadvantage in their PR campaigns. Why?  

### 17.6a Learning It: Public Relations

Public Relations (PR) is an organization's communication with its stakeholders. It's concern is building a positive image for the organization. Part of this effort is through advertising.  

Shifts in public expectation around ethical conduct have caused a growth in the importance of PR. Top executives are more involved. Some CEOs present themselves as the face of the company. PR is the publication of newsletters and brochures, but it's also communicating with the media, presenting updates of strategic alliances, managerial changes, financial statements.    

#### Publicity

Publicity is the aspect of PR related to promoting the organization and its products through unpaid channels, using news releases, media kits, press confrences, or holding special events. Publicity is not entirely free. There is the cost of staff, cost of holding events, and other costs associated with generating publicity.  

Publicity is often used to promote the organization's image, viewpoints, products, and structional changes. Using press releases to generate news stories is helps with the perception that the publicity's credibile. However the organization has very little control over whether a media outlet will actually run a story on it. It may even be used in a negative light.  

#### Cross-Promotion

Cross promotion happens with two companies share the cost of a promotional campaign that meets their mutual needs. Often these are similar or complementary products, but not always. Creative marketing can bring together unlikely partnerships. The text uses the example of the Android Kit-Kat.  

### 17.6b Ethics and PR

### 17.7a Learning It: Promotional Mix Effectiveness

Developing an effective promotional mix requires evaluating several factors.  

#### Nature of the Market

Consider the number and type of buyer. Advertising is good at reaching large numbers of customers over a wide geographical area. Personal selling works better for business customers, wholesalers, and consumers making high valued or high involvement purchases.  

#### Nature of the Product

Personal selling is a good choice for complex products, custom products, and products requiring frequent maintenance. Advertising is a good choice for standardized products, especially consumer goods like convenience products.  

#### Price

Low-unit-price products are typically sold using mass media advertising. High-priced goods like cars, boats, and homes, require qualified salespeople.

#### Stage in the Product Lifecycle

In the introductory stage, both personal and nonpersonal selling are used:  

* _Personal selling:_ Contacting marketing intermediaries to secure interest and commitments.
* _Trade Shows:_ Inform and educate prospective dealers and consumers about the new item.
* _Advertising and sales promotions:_ Creat awareness, information, stimulate initial purchases.

Durring growth and maturity, the mix should shift more heavily into advertising, used to persuade and remind consumers. Salespeole focus on convincing marketing intermediaries to expand distribution.  

As the maturity phase ends and the decline stage begins, both advertising and sales promotion reduces.  

#### Funds Available for Promotion

The high cost of some options, like highly viewed television events or celebrity endorsements, limits the firms that can utilize them. Smaller budgets do well to focus on sales promotion, online advertising, and publicity.
