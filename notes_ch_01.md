Vinyard Vines: Shep and Ian Murry didn't like the clothes they had to wear to the office. They started making neckties. From there they expanded into a full line of office friendly attire, with a fun attitude. They sell not only clothes, but a lifestyle, an attitude.  
Their success utilized _the four types of utility_, _the four variables of the marketing mix_, and a modern version of marketing.  

## 1.1 What Is Marketing?
"Summarize hoe marketing create value through the four types of utility"  

### Opening Example
Pepsi beats Diet coke for the number two spot without either product chainging their recipe or price. how?  

### 1.1a Learning It: What Is Marketing?
**Utility**: Ability of a product (good or service) to meet the consumers wants or needs.  
There are four basic types of utility: _form_, _time_, _place_, _ownership_.

**Form utility**: Combining materials (could be minerals, computer chips, people, services, etc.) together to create a product.  
**Time utility**: Making products available when the consumer wants them.  
**Place utility**: Making products available where the consumer where they are.  
**Ownership utility**: Transfering posession and title of a product to the buyer.  

**Marketing** is making, communicating, and delivering value to customers.  
These four types of utility provide value.  

### 1.1b Closing Example
Pepsi beat Diet Coke with a marketing campaign that connected emotionally with consumers. They encouraged them to 'like' their product on their web page, rewarded them with free cans of the soda, and provided a new attitude to connect with their "Taste Life Differently" slogan.  


## 1.2 Elements of Marketing Strategy
"describe the four variables of the marketing mix."  

### Opening Example
What did Howard Schultz do to change Starbucks from a single coffee shop in Seattle to a global brand with 28,000 locations in over 70 countries?  

### 1.2a Learning It: Elements of Marketing Strategy
Two basic elements:  
1. Identifying the _target market_ (in detail).  
2. Developing the correct _marketing mix_ (balance) of _product_, _price_, _distribution_, and _promotion_ to meet the markets wants and needs.  

### 1.2b Marketing Mix Variables
Sometimes called **"The 4 P's of marketing"**:  
* **_Product_**
* **_Price_**
* **_Place_**
* **_Promotion_**  
  
#### Product
A **product** is a good or service (or idea).  
Products are layered. A _product strategy_ can also include:  
* Customer service
* Package design
* Brand names
* Trademarks, patents, warranties

Example: Starbucks sells coffee, but it also sells an atmosphere (the physical space), a brand (reputation for quality), and a service (helpful, friendly baristas).  

#### Price
_Price strategy_ is the art of pricing a product to be competitive and profitable. Environmental factors like natural disasters and socio-economical factors can also affect pricing strategy.  

#### Place (Distribution)
A _distribution strategy_ should insure that products are available to the consumer in the quantity they desire as close (physically or technologically) to them as possible (ideally, right where they are).  
Decisions to realize a strategy can include how items are stored, transported, delivered, and the channels through which they are marketed.  
Amazon is a great example of an evolving and successful distribution strategy. You can order the item on your phone (exactly where you are). They have warehouses distributed across the globe and can deliver from the closest location to your location using any number of delivery services, including their own. Orders of some items can arrive within hours.  

#### Promotion
**Promotion** is at it's core, communication. Organizations use various channels to communicate with their potential customer. They communicate what their products offer, how it is different from the competition, price incentives, loyalty programs, etc. It is common that a _promotional strategy_ mix together many aspects of these communications in to a unified message. Integrated marketing communications (IMC) coordinates delivering the unified message through the various channels.  

### 1.2c Closing Example
Starbucks owes it's success in large part to:
* Building a culture (customer service, physical location, brand recognition).
* Providing products at different price points.
* Expanding world wide to make their product accessable.
* Using _promotional tactics_ to keep their brand valued.  

## 1.3 Five Eras of Marketing History
"Contrast the focus of marketing activities durring the five eras of marketing history."  

### Opening Example
Sue Kenworth took over her family business and found that her ideas around marketing differed from her father and grandfather's.  

### 1.3a Leanring It: Five Eras of Marketing History
1. The Production Era
2. The Sales Era
3. The marketing Era
4. The Relationship Era
5. The Social Era

#### Production Era (pre-1920s)
Called **Production orientation**, this era emphasised producing quality goods. The idea was, if you make a quality product, people will want to buy it.  

#### The Sales Era (pre-1950s)
More competition required selling. A **sales orientation** meant that sales staff and advertising could be used to direct the consumer to your product.  

### The Marketing Era (since 1950s)
The market shifts from _seller's market_ to _buyer's market_. **Marketing concepts** shift to a **consumer orientation**, focusing on the needs of the customers to drive product planning and marketing. Companies use _market research_ to understand the needs of their consumers so that they can focus on developing products to meet them.  

#### The Relationship Era (since 1990s)
Builds on the marketing concepts from the previous era, continuing to focus on growth, but also focusing on maintaining customers and suppliers by building relationships. Mailing lists and reward programs are examples of creating relationships with consumers.  

#### The Social Era (since 2000s)
Builds on the relationship ideas of the 90s, using the internet (a good website) and social media to connect with consumers.  

### 1.3b Closing Example
Times change. Modern times require a more evolved marketing strategy. Considering the lessons of all of the five eras are necessary to create a well rounded, successful marketing strategy.  

## 1.4 From Transaction-Based Marketing to Relationship Marketing
"Explain how relationship marketing can move customers up the loyalty ladder."  

The Weather Channel (TWC) delivered streaming TV content with a business model that consumers would tune in to see what was being presented. This is considered a **transaction-based strategy, where consumers check-in and receive what is available. The evolution of the internet introduced interactive sites where consumers could choose their content. TWC needed to build relationships with it's consumers on an individual level using these new technologies in order to stay viable.  

### 1.4a Learning It: From Transaction-Based Marketing to Relationship marketing
Beyond traditional markeing strategies of attracting new customers and making a sale, _relationship marketing_ focuses on creating repeat customers.  

**Relationship marketing** develops long-term relationships with partners (customers, suppliers, and other partners, even employees).  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The _loyalty ladder_ gives companies a strategy to move customers from acquisition (new customer) to unpaid representitive (supporter and advocate).

&nbsp;  

**Mobile marketing** connects with the consumer via email/texts/apps to maintain relationship and promote future purchases.  

**Social marketing** creates 'brand advocates' to promote brand, and interactive realationship for consumers with the brand for questions, answers, feedback.  

Examples:  
**Lolly Wolly Doodle**:  
Started as an almost accidental side hustle on eBay. Moved to Facebook and gained 1.5 million followers. As well as a large audience, Facebook allows feedback from customer base that helps direct the product development.  

**American Express**:  
Created a small business information resource via their web site to engage customers, provideing insites into business from business leaders. They also use other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram for this.  

By moving consumers up the loyalty latter, a company can generate repeat sales, as well as advocates that drive more consumers to their products.  

### 1.4b Closing Example
The Weather Channel adapted to new technology. They introduced an interactive mobile app and twitter channel, using feedback to influences TV programming. They provide customized content through thousands of localized media channels and use user data to analyze consumer behavior to inform their content. They also changed their name to Weather Company, to reflect the change in their business model.  

## 1.5 Categories of Marketing
"Differentiate the six categories of marketing."  

### Opening Example
The Obama reelection compaign in 2012 utilized _relationship marketing_ techniques, building websites to gather personal data about supporters. Strategists were able to recruit many of these as advocates who spread information through their social networks.  
How does this relate to marketing products, as discussed so far?  

### 1.5a Learning It: Categories of Marketing
#### Six Categories of Marketing

| Type | Objectives | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
|**Product<br />Marketing**| Marketing efforts designed to<br />communicate the benefits of a<br />good or service and persuade<br />target consumers to buy | Subaru: "Love. It's what makes<br />a Subaru a Subaru."<br />&nbsp;<br />Geico: "15 minutes will save<br />you 15% on car insurance."<br />Nike: "Just do it." |
| **Person<br />Marketing** | Marketing efforts designed<br />to cultivate the attention and<br />preference of a target market<br />toward a person | Russell Wilson, Seattle<br />&nbsp;<br />Seahawks quarterback<br />&nbsp;<br />Celebrity Blake Shelton,<br />country singer |
| **Place<br />Marketing** | Marketing efforts designed to<br />attract visitors to a particular<br />area; improve consumer<br />images of a city, state, or<br />nation; and/or attract new<br />business | California: "Find Yourself Here."<br />&nbsp;<br />Tennessee: "We're Playing Your Song."<br />&nbsp;<br />West Virginia: "Wild and Wonderful." |
| **Cause<br />Marketing** | Identification and marketing of<br />a social issue, cause, or idea to selected target markets | "Click it or Ticket."<br />&nbsp;<br />"Refill, not landfill." |
| **Event<br />Marketing** | Marketing of sporting, cultural,<br />and charitable activities to<br />selected target markets | Paris 2024 Summer Olympics<br />&nbsp;<br />American Diabetes<br />Association Tour de Cure |
| **Organization<br />Marketing** | Marketing efforts of mutual-<br />benefit organizations, service<br />organizations, and government<br />organization that seek to<br />influence others to accept their<br />goals, receive their services, or<br />contribute to them in some<br />way | American Red Cross:<br />"Together, we can save a life"<br />&nbsp;<br />March of Dimes: "Working<br />together for stronger, healthier<br />babies."<br />&nbsp;<br />St. Jude Childrens's Research<br />Hospital: "Finding Cures.<br />Saving Children." |

#### Overlap Between Marketing Categories
These categories can overlap.  

Example: Avon uses the cause of Breast Cancer (Cause Marketing) to promote it's product (Product Marketing).  

Example: When Oprah promotes her personal brand (Herself, i.e. Person Marketing), this also promoting her magazines, books, TV programs, etc. (Product Marketing).  

Example: Staples promotes it's brand (Product Marketing) by partnering with the Boy's and Girl's Clubs of America (Organization Marketing) in supporting it's back to school supplies drive (Cause Marketing).  

[comment]: # (Add Ven Diagram if possible: Overlap between Product/Organization/Cause Marketing in last example above)

### 1.5b Closing Example
Obama used modern marketing techniques, like relationship building through social media, to develop doners, voters, and volunteers. This is now the standard for modern campaigns.  

## 1.6 Eight Functions of Marketing Physical Goods
"Identify the eight functions of marketing physical goods."  

### Opening Example
Sam's Sub Shop opened with a marketing campaign boasting it's Honey Roasted Turkey. The response was so positive, they ran out of the product within the first two weeks. They reordered the product, but it was spoiled. Before they could recover, negative word of mouth by disapointed customers unable to get their turkey on killed sales and the shop went out of busines.  
What did the owners do wrong, and what can be learned about marketing from their example?  

### 1.6a Learning It: Eight Functions of Marketing Physical Goods
Along with the cost of the tangible production of the product (utility of form), half the product's price is typically it's marketing (utility of time, place, and ownership). There are eight underlying functions of marketing involved in this.    

<center>

#### The Eight Universal Function of Marketing
| Function | What Is It? | Why Is It Important? | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|---------|
**Buying** | Ensuring that<br />product offerings<br />are available in<br />sufficient<br />quantities to meet<br />customer<br />demands. | Marketers must be<br />able to satisfy<br />consumers' wants<br />and needs<br />promptly and<br />ahead of<br />consumption. | A bakery must<br />have enough flour<br />on hand to give<br />customers a<br />reliable supply of<br />bread. |
| **Selling** | Using advertising,<br />personal selling,<br />and sales<br />promotion to<br />match products to<br />customer needs. | Marketers must<br />communicate with<br />consumers about<br />how their products<br />create value. | A consumer<br />planning a day at<br />the beach wants to<br />know what<br />sunscreens are<br />most effective. |
| **Transporting** | Moving products<br />from their point of<br />productioin t<br />locations<br />convenient for<br />purchaser. | Marketers create<br />place utility by<br />making goods and<br />services available<br />where people want<br />to buy them. | One of Amazon's<br />biggest<br />competitive<br />strengths is its<br />ability to transport<br />virtually any<br />goods anywhere. |
| **Standardizing<br />and Grading** | Ensuring that<br />product offerings<br />meet quality and<br />quantitiy controls<br />of size, weight, and<br />other variables. | Marketers must<br />meet consumers'<br />expectatinos of<br />product size,<br />weight, and so on. | A tire dealer must<br />offer tires in<br />standard sizes that<br />consumers know<br />will fit their cars. |
| **Financing** | Providing credit<br />for channel<br />members<br />(wholesalers and<br />retailer) and<br />consumers. | Wholesalers and<br />retailers often<br />need access to<br />funds to finance<br />product inventory<br />prior to sale.<br />Consumers often<br />need the option of<br />using credit cards<br />to buy. | At holiday time<br />when they make<br />many purchases,<br />consumers prefer<br />using credit cards<br />instead of carrying<br />large amounts of<br />cash. |
| **Risk Taking** | Dealing with<br />uncertainty about<br />future customer purchases. | When<br />manufacturers<br />creat products<br />based on research,<br />they believe<br />consumers need<br />those products.<br />Companies<br />accomodate<br />these uncertainties<br />about future<br />demand when they<br />bring goods to<br />market. | Toy makers like<br />Mattel offer<br />innovative toys<br />each year based<br />on their forecast of<br />liekly trends in<br />children's play. |
| **Securing<br />Marketing<br />Information** | Collection<br />Information about<br />consumers,<br />competitors, and<br />channel members<br />for use in decision-<br />making. | Analysis of<br />marketing<br />information helps<br />marketers<br />understand why<br />consumers<br />purchase some<br />goods and not<br />others. This also<br />helps determine<br />what consumers<br />want and need,<br />and how to satisfy<br />those wants and<br />needs. | May hotels ask<br />customers to<br />complete a<br />satisfaction survey<br />after their stays so<br />that the hotel will<br />know if their<br />rooms and service<br />meet the needs of<br />travelers. |

### 1.6b  Closing Example
Think of the _eight functions of marketing_ as links in a chain. Sam's Sub Shop did a great job at _selling_, but failed at _buying_ enough product to meet consumer needs, and at _transporting_ (and storing) a resupply when they needed more product. Although no information was provided, the other five functions would also be in play in a sub-shop scenerio.  

## 1.7 Analyzing Marketing Strategy
"Given a description of a company's marketing mix, classify the elements of the marketing mix and the category of marketing."  
_Marketing Mix_: The four P's  

### Opening Example
Vinyard Vines clothing is offered through 100 theme stores, retail chains, catalogs, and their web site. They also licence to major league sports organizations. They send sales representitives to colleges to target students and establish potentially life long relationships. And they use social media and targeted give-aways to develop _relationship marketing_ with consumers (one-on-one and advocacy).  

_Describe the key elements of their marketing mix._  

### 1.7a Learing It: Analyzing Marketing Strategy
Customer driven-organizations must define their target market.  
Vinyard Vines targets college students and young professionals.  
Customer driven-organizations must communicate how their product satisfies the consumers needs to the consumer.  

#### Product Strategy
Expand the product line to a larger pool of customers (women and children). Strong brand recognition through standardizing design decisions and it's recognizable logo. Trademarked name. Placed in a profitable competition tier (Polo, Ralph Lauren).  

### Pricing Strategy
Maintains position as a premium brand, with occasional seasonal promotions to reach new customers without undercutting it's competition tier. This product is not available at Target or BJs.

VV uses company-owned stores, upscale retailers, and the internet to distribute it's product line. It also uses licencing, and places products on college campuses (school store).  

#### Promotion Strategy
"Living the Dream." VV communicates through social media, personal connection through sales representitives, and through targted promotions (free for college students). They maintain "recognizable visual elements" to create a unified marketing strategy.  

## 1.8 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
They started selling out of the trunk of their car (really?), but have steadily grown and continue to learn from their experience. They are incorporating more metrics and data analytics to improve the way they connect with their customer base, and are partnering with celebrities like sportscaster Jim Nantz, opening a store at Pebble Beach. The West Coast location lets them connect with that side of the countries customers, to better grow the brand name nationally.
