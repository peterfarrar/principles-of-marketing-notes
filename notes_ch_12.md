### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

Zappos has grown from a small online shoe business to a large subsitiary of Amazon, adding apparel brands, handbags, luggage, and home furnishings to its inventory.  
Zappos buyers are aligned around lifestyles, and are passionate participants in the lifestyle they represent. So if a buyer is focused on camping products, it's because they're an avid camper, and so intimately aware of thier product space.  
Zappos also listens to customer feedback And if enough interest is shown in a product they will integrate it into their offerings.  
But much of Zappos success comes from executing core strategies that work in most product categories and businesses. What are these strategies that give Zappos a competitive edge?  

## 12.1 Strategies for New Product Development

"Summarize the four strategies for new product development."  

### Opening Example

The Harley Davidson has successfully marketed masculine and individualistic images to sell their motorcycles for over 100 years, as well as successfully marketing branded merch like jackets and T-shirts. In the '90s they tried to offer some new branded products, like aftershave, perfume, and wine coolers, but these products failed to gain market share. What were they thinking and where did they go wrong?  

### 12.1a Learning It: Strategies for New Product Development

There are four alternative product development strategies: **market penetration**, **market development**, **product development**, and **product diversification**.  

Choosing a strategy depends on:  

* The existing **product mix**
* The match between current offerings and overall marketing objectives
* The products' current market positions

#### Market Penetration Strategy

Gain market share for an existing product. This can be accomplished by modifying the product, improving the quality of the product, promoting in new and different ways.   

#### Market Developmnet Strategy

Find new markets for existing products. This could include a new geographical region, a new use for an existing product, marketing to a different demographic.

#### Product Development Strategy

Introduce new products in existing markets. This could be a replacement product, like a technological improvement to an existing product (Replace HD with 4K TV).  

#### Product Diversification Strategy

Developing new products for new markets. Snack makers introducing healthy snacks for the growing healthy snack market, game makers expanding into phone based games.  

### 12.1b Closing Example

Harley Davidson's enterance into the cosmetics and wine markets was a form of product diversification. However these markets didn't align with their tough-guy brand identity.  

## 12.2 The New Product Development Process

"Describe the six steps in the product development process."  

### Opening Example

Companies like L'Oréal want to insulate themselves against new product failures. There is no guarentee that a new product wont fail. But there are tried and true steps in product development to minimize the risk.  

### 12.2a Learning It: The New Product Development Process

The failure rate for new products is around 80%. There are many reasons, including product defects, poor screeinging and project evaluation, inadequate launch efforts or market assessments.  
Risks can be diminished by following the siz-step develompent process:  

1. idea generation
2. screening
3. business analysis
4. development
5. test marketing
6. commercialization

At each step a decision is made about whether to proceed or abandon the product.  
This process works best for firms that dominate mature markets, with many products to develop variations on. In rapidly emerging markets, keeping to the six steps can be more difficult.  

#### Idea Generation

Suggestions can come from customers, sellers, R&D specialist, competing products, suppliers, retailers, inventors.  

#### Screening

The purpose is to seperate  commercially viabile products from those that are not. Checklists of commercial viability can include price and availability of materials, compatibility with current offerings, brand alignment, uniqueness.  

#### Business Analysis

This involves assessing the potential market, growth rate, and competitive strengths of the product. Also, evaluating the compatability with company resources, for example manufacturing and storage requirements.  

#### Development

Prototypes and/or test runs of the product are created. Engineers turn the idea into a real product. Marketers gather feedback on consumer reactions to the product, its design, packaging, etc. This stage introduces significantly more cost than the previous three stages.  

#### Test Marketing

The product is marketed in a limited manor and its success is gauged. If it struggles, it may be modified and reintroduced, or it may be scrapped.  

#### Commercialization

The product is ready for the general market. This is the most expensive part of the process. Marketing strageties have been developed, manufacturing is scaled up, and the sales force, marketing partners, and potential consumers are to be acquanted with the product.  

### 12.2b Closing Example

While L'Oréal was unsuccessful with Inneov, an anti-frizz hair product, they have one of the most rigourous product development processes in the industry, which has made them more successful than most.  

## 12.3 New Product Adoption

"Describe the five categories of purchasers based on relative time to adoption."  

### Opening Example

Families ranging in age from 6 to 86 adopt new products at different rates. Attitudes and speed of adoption vary around new technologies like smart-phones and VR, for example.  
There are five general categories of purchaser. Why is this important to marketers?  

### 12.3a Learning It: New Product Adoption

The **adoption process** is a series of stages from first learning about a product to trying and buying or rejecting it. Marketers consider this in five stages:  

1. _Awareness:_ Individuals learn of a product, but don't know much about it.
2. _Interest:_ Potential buyers seek to learn more about the product.
3. _Evaluation:_ The benefits of the new product are considered.
4. _Trial:_ The product is tried, maybe even purchased, to see if it's useful.
5. _Adoption/Rejection:_ Based on the experience of the trial, the consumer either chooses to use the product regularly, or rejects the product.

Marketers can take steps to identify consumers at the interest stage, and help to move them through the evaluation and trial stages.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

### 12.3b The Diffusion Process

Different consumers adopt new products and technologies at different rate. This is refered to as the **diffusion process**.

    <div class="labels center">
        <span>Consumer Innovators 2.5%</span>
        <span>Early Adopters 13.5%</span>
        <span>Early Majority 34%</span>
        <span>Late Majority 34%</span>
        <span>Laggards 16%</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
&nbsp;

#### Innovators

Innovators tend to be highly educated, younger, more willing to take risks on new technology.  

#### Early Adopters

Early adopters are more concerned with how others percieve them. They want to be thought of as leaders, and are often opinion leaders.  

#### Early Majority

These tend to be mainstream, with middle class income and education. THey tend to wait and see, before buying a new product.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Late Majority

Generally older and more risk-averse. They adopt new products near the end of the diffusion process. Motivations may include peer presure or work requirements.  

#### Laggards

Laggards fear change and have traditional mindsets and behaviors. The are typically older and in lower social classes than the other four categories of adopters.  

While the diffusion process is present with all new products, it is especially visible with new technologies. Innovators seek them out, and early adpoters watch to see what might be useful. The late majority is typically waiting for price reductions and other incentives before making their first purchase. And laggards may never try a new product at all if they can avoid it.  

### 12.3c Factors Affection Rates of Adoption

Marketers have five characteristics they can use to influence the adoption process:  

1. _Relative advantage:_ Innovations that appear superior to the previous solution has a _greater relative advantage_. This could be lower price, physical improvements, or ease of use.
2. _Compatibility:_ If the new product is percieved to be compatible with the values of the consumer, adoption speed can be faster.
3. _Complexity:_ Consumers are slow to adopt what they don't understand. Marketers can simplify the perception of the product to improve adoption.
4. _Possibility of trial use:_ Free or reduced cost lowers financial risk to consumers and can increase adoption speed.
5. _Observability:_ Demonstration in-store or in advertisments that demonstrate the products superiority over previous solutions can improve adoption rates. 

### 12.3d Closing Example

Understanding the stages of adoption can help marketers target innovators and early adopters, increasing the speed of adoption through the diffusion process.  

## 12.4 The Product Lifecycle

"Differentiate the four stages of the product lifecycle in terms of industry sales and profits."  

### Opening Example

People have a lifecycle. First we are infants, then children, then adults, and finally old age and death. Products have a lifecycle too. Marketers have names for these stages and understand them in terms of their place in the industry, sales, and profits.  

### 12.4a Learning It: The Product Lifecycle

The **product lifecycle** refers to the progression of a product or product category through four basic stages within its industry.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Introductory Stage

This is the new-market entry for a product or product category. Consumers start to become acquainted. Profits are low, and costs can be substantial as the product is adapted to the market response, or technological advances.  

#### Growth Stage

Industry profits peak as more consumers purchase the product and early purchasers return to buy again. Profitability pulls new entrants into the market, which can ultimately lead to a decline in industry profits as competition forces lower pricing.  

#### Maturity Stage

Sales continue to grow durring the early part of this phase, but then plateau. Profits continue to decline due to the number of competitors in the market.  

#### Decline Stage

Shifts in consumer preferences continue the decline in sales and profitablilty. New technology creates new products that replace the old ones.  

### 12.4b Closing Example

New innovations will one day be obsolete, like the eight track tape and the rotary phone. Companies face the challenge of trying to invest in products that will have long life-spans. But we can't really know for sure.  

## 12.5 Marketing Across the Product Lifecycle

"Given an example of a product, identify marketing strategies for that product's stage of the product lifecycle."  

### Opening Example

Lipton created the dried onion soup mix to help families speed up the process of making homemade soup. But over time fewer homes made soup from scratch.  
Lipton added the recipe for onion dip to the packets in 1958. Today 220,000 packets of soup are used daily, mostly for onion dip.  
What is the term for what Lipton did to extend the life of their dried onion soup?  

### 12.5a Learning It: Marketing Across the Product Lifecycle

Marketers tailor thier decisions based on the lifecycle stage of a particular product.  


In the introductory phase, promotions are used to introduce the consumer to the product, and to encourage distribution partners to carry the product.  

Durring the growth phase, word-of-mouth reports, mass advertising, low prices and other sales promotions help consumers make trial purchases.  

At the maturity stage, promotional efforts emphasize the differences between competing products.  

In the decline stage, promotional expenses are reduced, fewer models and options streamline production costs, and proces are cut to stay competitive.

### 12.5b Extending the Product Lifecycle

Marketers usually try to extend phases of the lifecycle.  

#### Increasing Frequency of Use

During the maturity stage, marketers can try to increase total sales by influencing existing customers to buy more frequently.  

#### Increasing the Number of Users

Marketers can also try to attract new customers through changes in advertising, packaging, or materials.  

#### Finding New Users

Finding new uses for old products in another way to extend the life of a mature product.  

### 12.5c Closing Example

A market development strategy allowed Lipton to extend the life of a mature product in its dried onion soup mix by encouraging consumers to use it as an ingredient in a new recipe for onion dip.   

## 12.6 The Product Mix

"Distinguish product mix breadth from prodcut line depth."  

### Opening Example

Johnson & Johnson's offers retail consumer products, business-to-business products to the medical community, and through subsitiaries, they offer diabetes management products, and orthopedic implants and joint replacement products.  
This may appear like a random assortment of healthcare products, but it's not. Do you know how these products relate to eachother?  

### 12.6a Learning It: The Product Mix

#### Product Line

A group of related products sold under a single brand.  

#### Product Mix

Assortment of product lines and individual offerings. These are typically measured by their product mix breadth and product line depth.  

#### Product Mix Breadth

The number of different product lines the firm offers.

#### Product Line Depth

The number of variations in each product line (size, flavor, color, trim level).  

### 12.6b Managing the Product Mix

Adding breadth and depth requires careful thought. Marketers can ask two questions to assess if there is a need to add to these:  

1. Has the firm ignored a viable consumer segment? This could be resolved by adding depth (new variations) to appeal to this segment.  
2. Does the firm gain equal contributions from all items in its portfolio? Reducing breadth (cutting product lines) could cut costs and increase revenues.  

Sometimes increasing both breadth and depth is the right choice. Sometimes reducing one or both is the better choice.  

### 12.6c Closing Example

Johnson & Johnson's breasth in its health care product mix has helped it with its success, addressing ranges of needs across multiple sectors. And their product line depth means that they can meet the needs of many kinds of consumers, from children to the elderly.  

## 12.7 Quality as a Product Strategy

"Summarize methods commonly used for measuring and managing product quality."  

### Opening Example

The Cheesecake factory topped a survey of customer satisfaction for restaurants in the "casual-dining" segment. The quality of the food was considered high. But unlike tangable goods, typically measured by how it functions or how long it lasts, the service part of a restaurant experience weighs heavily measuring customer satisfaction. This is trickier to measure. How can marketers pursue quality as a product strategy for both goods and services?  

### 12.7a Learning It:

Quality is a key element of success in a competitive market. The EU's ISO 9001 standards defome gemeroc croteroa fpr quality management and quality assurance. ISO certification is a prerequisite for suppliers by many companies.  

Methods of ensuring quality are:  

#### Benchmarking

The benchmarking process has three parts:  

* Identify manufacturing or business processes that need improvement
* Compare internal processes to industry leaders'
* Implement changes for quality improvement

Analysis should start with an internal assessment of strengths and weaknesses as a baseline. Secondly, information should be gathered about the benchmark partner to determine what it is that sets the perception of them as an industry leader. A comparison of results can set an objective basis for improvements. Often benchmarking takes place cyclicly, to maintain focus quality and improvement.  

#### Lean and Six Sigma

These quality-improvement tools seek to boost the efficiency of production and marketing processes. Lean focuses on identifying and eliminating waste. Sigma Six focuses on defects and variations. For example, Lean might identify cost savings in the supply chain, while Sigma Six could identify inconsistancies and recommend standardization in the retail experience.  

### 12.7b Quality of Services

Interaction with a service provider is called a **service encounter**. Depending on the custoemr experience during a service encounter, a consumer may or may not choose to return. They may also share their impressions of the experience with others, influcencing their behavior as well.  

**Service quality** has five variables:

1. _Tangibles:_ The physical appearence of providers and the environment.
2. _Reliability:_ Consistency and dependability.
3. _Responsiveness:_ The readiness to serve.
4. _Assurances:_ Confidence communicated by the provider.
5. _Empath:_ Understanding and readiness to fulfill the customers' needs.

Quality of service is measured by the customer as the gap between the level of service expected and the level of service received. High levels of service can expect a higher likelyhood of repeat business, while low levels can cause the customer to seek out alternatives.  

### 12.7c Closing Example

The Cheesecake Factory topped the survey for customer satisfaction not only for the quality of its food. Customers liked the atmosphere. And Cheesecake factory works with IBM and N2N Global to collect and analyse data, allowing it to identify and rectify problems, continually emphasising quality in its products and services.  

### 11.8 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

While Zappos success is in part from developing and managing a unique selection of products, many of those products are offered elsewhere. Their commitment to quality customer service, however, is the reason that many consumers still prefer to purchase from Zappos.
