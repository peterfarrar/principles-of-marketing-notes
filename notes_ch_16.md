### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

George Thomas David started GT's Kombucha in LA, using his parents SCOBY (a combination of yeast and bacteria). Originally it sold in local healthfood markets, then it was picked up by Whole Foods, and went viral when movie starts were seen drinking it.  

GT's holds 40% of the Kombucha market, is the largest Kombucha globally, and competes with Coke and Pepsi brands. Should GT's Living Foods compete head to head with these brands in the same stores? Where else might they be sold?  

## 16.1 Retailing in the United States

"Describe the retailing sector in the United States in terms of size, major companies, and marketing channels."  

### Opening Example

Tractor Supply Co. (TSC) marketers are trying to decide how to respond to market changes.   

One marketer thinks that they should expand into more brick and mortor stores. They point out that only 30% of their products are available through the website, and that their target market, owners of small farms, hunters, and equestrians, are less likely than most consumers to make online purchases.  

The other agrees that more brick and mortor stores are an important part of the companies growth strategy, but notes that other general merchandise realters and department stores are seeing an increase in online shopping, and thinks that focusing on e-commerse will have the biggest impact.  

Which marketer is right? What's the right choice for TSC?  

### 16.1a Learning It: Retailing in the United States

Retailers are the marketing intermediaries in direct contact with the consumer. Most consumers have little to no contact with the manufacturer and retailers are their connection to the distribution channel. Retailers use store hours, product location, store layout, merchandise selection, and return policies to influence the consumers perception of their offerings.  

Retail sales in the U.S. in 2019 were $3.77 trillion, accounting for $2.6 trillion of the annual GDP. They provide 29 million jobs, making them the largest private-sector employer in the country. While many of the largest retailers continue to open new stores, many retailers are closing stores due to changes in consumer shopping habbits.

Technology is changing the way consumers shop. Retailers have added e-commerce sites to complement their traditional brick-and-mortor stores. It's estimated that 1.8 billion consumers purchased goods online in 2018.  

### 16.1b Closing Example

TSC has continued to experience growth over the last decade. Because of the size and specialized nature of their products they don't worry much about online competitors. But they've also been increasing their online presence. Their "buy online, pick up in store" feature helped drive triple-digit growth in their e-commerce sales.  

Marketers don't have to choose between online and brick-and-mortor growth, as TSC demonstrates. It's important to understand the shifting dynamics of how and where consumers want to make purchases.  

## 16.2 Retailing Strategy

"Describe the six components of retail strategy."  

### Opening Example

Mary Dillon became the CEO of Ultra in 2013. Ultra had been in existence for 25 years and was the biggest specialty retailer by sales. But, with 20,000 products sold in 900 stores, they only had a 4% share of the $127 billion beauty market. Dillon had experience marketing for Gaterade, McDonald's, and U.S. Cellular. What can Marry Dillon do to increase brand awareness?  

### 16.2a Learning It: Retailing Strategy

A retailer's marketing strategy uses a retailing mix based on the six components of retail strategy. These components work together to create a consistent image that appeals to the target market:  

* Merchandising
* Customer Service
* Pricing
* Location/Distribution
* Promotional
* Store

#### Merchandising Strategy

A merchanising strategy informs decisions about the items a retailer will offer. Typical decisions are around general merchandise categories, product lines, specific items within lines, and the depth and width of its assortments.  

#### Customer Service Strategy

A customer service strategy specifies which services a retailer will offer, and if there is an additional cost. Stratgies can include gift wrapping, alterations, return policies, bridal registries, consulting services, delviery and installation, and online shopping.  

#### Pricing Strategy

Pricing strategy reflects the marketing objective of the retailer. Prestige vs. competitive, vs cost leaders.  

#### Location/Distribution Strategy

Location strategy depends on factors like the type of merchandise, financial resources, characteristics of the target market, and site availability.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Promotional Strategy

Promotional strategy seeks to communicate information about retailer's locations, selections, hours of operation, and prices. When merchandise changes frequently advertising is used to promote current styles, trends, offerings effectivly. loyalty programs can help to create repeat business.  

#### Store Atmospherics

Atmospherics are physical characteristics and amenities that attract customers. They include interior and exterior features and décor.

### 16.2b Closing Example

Paying attention to store atmospherics, and the customer service strategy, among other elements of the retailing mix, have helped Mary Dillon realize increased sales, market share, and locations for Ultra.  

## 16.3 Strategic Considerations for Retail Strategy

"Given a component of retail strategy, summarize the key strategic considerations for that component."  

### Opening Example

Best Buy is the largest consumer-electronics retailer in the world. There are over 1,000 locations, and they are expecting to pick up more marketshare following their main competitors shift to 100% online. But only a few years ago, Circuit City closed and it looked like Best Buy was in decline. What considerations did Best Buy make to its retail strategy to turn itself around?  

### 16.3a Learning It: Strategic Considerations for Retail Strategy

Retailers start to define theiry retail strategy by selecting a target market. They use demographic, geographic, and psychographic profiles to segment markets. Once identified, they develop a retailing mix to match the market.  

#### Merchandising Strategy

To develop a successful merchandise mix, retailers consider preferences of their target market, the competitive environment, and the profitability of products, 
product lines and product catagories.  

#### Customer Service Strategy

Choosing services to offer depends on a number of considerations including: what the competition is doing, what the pricing strategy is, what merchandise is available, customer expectations, and financial resources. The goal of customer service is to attract and retain customers, increasing sales and profits. Examples include: in-store services, delivery/assembly services, generous return policies, advisory services (knowledgable sales staff).  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Pricing Strategy

Pricing strategy is based on several key factors: type of product, company objectives, competitor pricing, customer perceptions. Markup results from two decisions:  

1. _Services performed by the retailer:_ Stores that offer more services charge more to cover those costs.
2. _Inventory turnover rate:_ Stores with higher turnover can cover their costs with a smaller markup.

Pricing strategy influences the retailers image, and impacts their ability to attract customers.  

#### Location/Distribution Strategy

Location and number of stores is an important part of the distribution strategy. Considerations include proximity to competitors, cost to build or rent, types of products sold, convenience and expectations of customers.  

Distribution impacts the ability to get the customer and the product together. Ideas like buy online and pick up in store, free shipping, free shipping to store, are aspects of a distirbution strategy.  

#### Promotional Strategy

There are many channels to promote goods through advertising, social media, instore promotions, etc. A retail promotional strategy needs to consider the target market, store location, financial resources. For example, younger consumers spend far more time online and on social-media than watching television or reading newspapers. A coffee shop located in a mall is in a high traffic area and has less need to attract customers to its location. A large company like Best Buy can afford to spend money on more expensive advertising channels, like television and radio.  

#### Store Atmospherics

The appearence of the interior and exterior of a store reflect on the retailers image. Retailers may also consider more than just practical aspects of a store's atmosphere. The physical appearence can attract customers, but the right environment can also draw in people out shopping to escape the routine events of their life, to endulge in escapism, or to socialize.  

### 16.3b Closing Example

Hubert Joly, CEO of Best Buy in 2012, started a campaign to revive the brand. Key points were:  

* Reinvigorate and rejuvenate the customer experience
* Work with vendor partners to innovate and drive value
* Enhancing in-stock performance
* Price matching
* Enhancing in-store pickup
* Creating store-within-a-store format
* Employee training

He also enhanced physical location and swapped some large stores for a smaller store format. Using this retail strategy turned Best Buy around and made it the largest electronics retailer in the world.   

## 16.4 Catgorizing Retailers

"Outline the four bases for categorizing retailers."  

### Opening Example

Retailers selling similar items may use very different retail strategies. For example,  _Stich Fix_ and _Nordstrom_ are both clothing and accessory retailers. Stich Fix sells through the mail, sending "members" five items of clothing a month. The customer can try on the clothing, keep and pay for what they like, and send back what they don't like. Nordstrom uses high end retail locations, as well as their website, to sell their items, and include personal stylists, alterations and tayloring, and a store credit card. These retailers are categorized differently because while both sell similar items, they do it in very different ways.  

### 16.4a Learning It: Catgorizing Retailers

There is no universal classification system for retailers. New types evolve as consumer demand changes. Some methods of defining retail differences are:  

* Form of ownership
* Shopping effort expended by customers
* Services provided to customers
* Product lines carried

These categories are not mutually exclusive.  

#### Classification by Form of Ownership

The easiest way to differentiate retailers is by form of ownership, chains stores vs. independent retailer.  

An independent retailer is someone responsible for their own business.  

Chain stores are groups of outlets operating under central ownership and management. The large volumes by which they purchase products allows them to utilize economies of scale. They can also afford extensive advertising, sales training, and utilize computerized systems to order and manage merchandise, forecast sales, and accounting.  

#### Classification by Shopping Effort

Stores can be classified as _convenience_, _shopping_, or _specialty_ retailers.  

_Convenience retailers_ focus on making their locations accessable, use extended hours to be available, have rapid checkouts, and adequate parking.  
_Shopping retailers_ offer items that consumers generally price shop. They differentiate themselves with advertising and instore displays, offer well trained and knowledgeable sales-people, and offer an appropriate assortmant of merchandise.  
_Specialty retailers_ use carefully defined product lines, along with services and reputation, to attract consumers and persuade them to expend considerable effort to shop at their stores.  

<div class="pagebreak" />

#### Classification by Services Provided

Stores can be classified by the services they provide their customers. The continuum is broken down as follows:  

* Self-service
* Self-selection
* Full-service

Most retailers fall somewhere in the self-selection category, where the consumer can choose their own goods, but there is staff available if assistance is needed.  

#### Classification by Product Lines

Product line classification breaks down into three categories:  

* Specialty stores
* General merchandise retailers
* Food retailers

_Specialty stores_ focus on a specific, narrow category of merchandise. These can be chains, but are often independantly owned. These retailers have a great deal of knowledge applicable to their product specialty.  
_General merchandise retailers_ Carry a wide variety of product lines. These include variety stores, department stores, and mass merchandisers.  
_Food retailers_ are a mix between specialty and general merchandise. Some focus on a narrow line of products, like a fish market. Grocery stores focus on selling a wide variety of food products, and also carry related items like household goods (lightbulbs, dust pans) or basic office supplies (pens, paper, pads).  

### 16.4b Closing Example

Comparing Stitch Fix (SF) and Nordstroms, SF is independently owned, Nordstrom is a chain store. Both could be considered specialty stores. Each offer services. SF offers personal styling services, so could be considered a full service retailer. Nodrdstrom customers can select items on their own, or through a personal stylist, categorizing it as both self-selection and full-service. SF sells clothing and accessories and is considered a specialty retailer, while Nordstrom also carries household goods, cookware, dinnerware, and more, making it a department store; a series of specialty stores under the same roof.  

## 16.5 Direct Marketing and Nonstore Retailing

"Describe the five basic types of direct marketing and nonstore retailing."  

### Opening Example

In our opening example, a couple of students are brainstorming ideas for either a new product or a new way to sell an existing product. The idea they come up with is to sell razors online for a steep discount over what's charged in convenience and grocery stores. Is it a good idea to start a company that soley sells razors online?  

<div class="pagebreak" />

### 16.5a Learning It: Direct Marketing and Nonstore Retailing

Direct markting and nonstore retailing include:  

* Direct mail
* Direct selling
* Online retailing
* Direct-response retailing
* Automatic merchandising

#### Direct Mail

Used by both for and not-for profit organizations, direct mail includes:  

* Sales letters
* Postcards
* Brochures
* Booklets
* Catalogs
* DVD's

Advantages of direct mail include:  

* The ability to choose a narrow target market
* Intensive coverage
* Quick delivery of messaging
* Multiple formats to choose from
* Able to provide a great deal of information
* Can be personalized
* Doesn't compete with other adds in publications or on television

Disadvantages:  

* Cost
* Many people do not like to receive junk mail

Marketers are shifting these kinds of efforts from mail to digital marketing.  

#### Direct Selling

Manufacturers bypass traditional distribution channels and market directly to the consumer. Avon is an example of direct selling.  

#### Online Retailing

This involves using e-commerce stores on the internet. Amazon is an example of a large online retailer, but small businesses can also thrive online. Brick and mortor changes are rapidly establishing an online retail presence.    

#### Direct-Response Retailing

Direct response retailing is a combination of physical, online, and direct mail retailing. Customers order merchandise in a number of ways, phone, internet, in-store, and their product is delivered either to their home, or to a retail location for pick-up. Catalogs used to be a major source of orders, but now are used to drive sales to the retailers internet site.    

#### Automatic Merchandising

There are around 18,000 vending machines in the U.S. generating $7 billion in mostly snacks, beverages, and lottery tickets. In Japan consumers purchase a wide variety of merchanise from vending machines. The space in the U.S. is changing, with some companies trying to sell healthier consumables. In airports there are vending machines that sell accessories for computers and phones, and other non-edible consumer goods.  

### 16.5b Closing Example

While this is not the actual way in which Dollar Shave Club started, the business is a great example of direct marketing and non-store retailing. Selling razors and razor blades cheaply to men on a subscription model allowed Dollar Shave Club to take in $65 million in revenue in its third year. The founder, Michael Durban, sold the company to Unilever for $1 billion dollars. It turned out to be a very good idea.  

## 16.6 Determining an Effective Retail Strategy for Manufacturers

"Given a manufacturer's goals for retailing their products, determine the most effective retail strategy."  

### Opening Example

GT's Living Foods was started by GT Dave when he was a teenager. He sold his first two cases to a local healthfood store in L.A. Word of mouth and repeat business helped the product land on mre small independent grocery stores' shelves. A few celebrities shared their love of the product and it took off. GT began delivering to weathy customers in Malabu, and to movie sets. Whole foods picked up the product line in 1999 and by 2010 GT was selling $35 of product a year.  

What elements should GT's Living Foods consider for their retail strategy?  

### 16.6a Learning It: Determining an Effective Retail Strategy for Manufacturers

Retail partners are selected based on their ability to reach the target market in a way that is consistent with the companies objectives and brand.  

* What types of retailers would attract the target market?
* What types of retailers either already do, or would be open to, carry a similar product?
* Should the product be sold in by a specialized retailer or a general merchandise retailer?
*  What types of retailers help accomplish the distribution intensity goals?
*  What type of retailers offer pricing objectives that are a good fit for the brand?
*  What types of retailers offer customer service and store atmospherics that would be good ot associate with the brand?

Considerations for GT's Living Food include parishability. Distribution and retail space is limited by the need for refrigeration. Opening multiple manufacturing facilities limits oversite of the operations. The premium status of small batch organic kombucha commands a premium price, which also impacts the choice of retailers. Choosing partners that promote in a way that reach the target market is also a consideration.  

### 16.7 Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow

GT's Living Foods are now sold nationwide in grocery stores, Target, Walmart, and Walgreens. This coincides with a 43% groth in kombucha sales nationally. As kombucha becomes more mainstream, GT is meeting the customers where they shop. Dave is looking to continue expanding the product line, and to expand sales into Europe. The retail strategy will continue to adjust with change.
