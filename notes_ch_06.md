### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Butternut mountain in the Berkshires is nowhere near as large as slopes north of it, in Vermont and New Hampshire, and tiny compared to the slopes in Colorado and Utah. But the mountain has appeal to a specific market. Using survays, and data collection, combined with 50 years of experience and interaction with its customers, marketers Matt Sawyer and Ed Brooks have found various methods to identify the factors that draw skiers to their slopes. And they can use these to influence consumers decisions and differenciate Butternut from the competition.  

## 6.1 Influences Affecting Consumer Behavior
"Identify the three types of influences that affect the consumer decision process."  

### Opening Example
Grocery stores make $2Million or more in sales per year. What influences consumer choices, planned vs. unplanned? How can retailers understand this decision process, before, durring, and after visiting their markets?  

### 6.1a Learning It: Influences Affecting Consumer Behavior
**Consumer behavior** is the process by which business and household consumers make decisions on how and what to buy. It is important for companies to understand what drives the customer's decision making, and what influences it.  

#### Social factors 
Decisions can be influenced by what people believe is expected of them. Examples: Choosing the school to attend, career choice, spouse and political affiliation, could be based on upbringing, and percieved expectations of that social circle.    

#### Psychological factors
Decisions are heavily influenced by internal factors, like identity/sense-of-self, personal needs, understanding, attitude. Examples: People that believe in climate change may be more inclined to purchase an electric car and recyclable goods.  

#### Situational factors
The state of the moment can influence decisions making. If you are lost or the trains have stopped running for the night, one might be more likely to take a can or rideshare. If hungry and choices are limited to junkfood, one might choose to eat something less healthy than they otherwise would. If one's work has a dress code they might purchase clothing they wouldn't wear otherwise.  

### 6.1b Closing Example
Aldi's understanding of consumer decision making and behavior allows them to compete while providing significantly fewer options than main stream grocers. Their partnership with Cookie and Kate (lifestyle blogger and influencer) was in part based on their understanding of psychological factors: that 56% of consumers want to eating healthier and/or lose weight (based on their New Year's resolution).  They also leverage situational factors: beliving consumers can be overwhelmed by too many choices they offer fewer items and claim to "offer only th ebest of customers' must-have groceries." And their _SimplyNature_ line addresses social factors of their target market by promoting the removal of 125 artificial ingredients.  

## 6.2 The Consumer Decision Process
"Outline the six steps in the consumer decision process."  

### Opening Example
Trevor wants a new vehical. Because he considers himself outdoorsie, and is a construction engineer, he wants a truck. How can marketers influence his decision making at each step of the decision making process?  

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

### 6.2a Learning It: The Consumer Decision Process
Consumers typically complete a six step process when making a purcase decision. Marketers often use their knowledge of this process to stear the consumer to their product.

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

</div>

#### Problem or Opportunity Recognition
_Step 1:_ The consumer recognizes an unmet need or want and desires to change their existing situation to the desired situation. It's a marketers job to help the consumer recognize this deficit and to inform them of a solution. This could be through a marketing campaign or a sales person. Ads durring sporting events depicting trucks in the wilderness and hauling cargo could influence someone like Trevor to desire that as part of their lifestyle, and even presents a specific brand to resolve that desire.  

#### Information Search
_Step 2:_ The consumer gathers information to achive the desired state. Internal search involves reviewing experiences and impressions, personal knowledge or biases, that the individual has inside their memory. External searchs can include research online, discussions with trusted friends, family members, co-workers, etc. The more expensive the item, the more time a consumer is likely to spend on this step. The result is called the **evoked set**, which includes possible brands and models to purchase. Immediate needs usually have a smaller evoked set (I need food here/now vs. on Valentines day). Similar to step 1, marketers can influence what is included in the evoked set through a variety of methods (advertising, marketing campaigns, social media, personal salesmen, etc.).  

#### Evaluation of Alternatives
_Step 3:_ An extention of the second step it to evaluate the evoked set and rank the contents. They will identify what aspects are important and establish their peronal set of cirteria. These can include facts and statistics, personal opinions, and emotional impressions. Marketers have three ways to influence this step:  
1. "Educate" consumers about what attributes are important in the product
2. "Educate" consumers about what criteria is important to them, and how their product meets that criteria.
3. If the consumer has not included their product in the evoked set, attempt to influence them to expand the set to include it.  

#### Purchase Decision and Purchase Act
_Step 4 and 5:_ Reaching a decision about what to purchase, the consumer must now decide where to purchase it. Here, factors like price, inventory, location, convenience, urgency, can all come into play.  

#### Post-Purchase Evaluation
_Step 6:_ Typically a consumer is happy if the product meets or exceeds expectation. Anxiety, called **congnitive dissonance**, can occur after purchase when knowledge and beliefs are out of alignment. This is a form of **buyer's remorse**. Factors like lower priced options, missing features, and a major overall effect on the buyer, can increase the dissonance. Marketers can help reduce dissonance by supplying them with information that will show the item in a positive light (like providing information that demonstrate other's being satisfied with the product), providing follow up personal attention, and quality customer service. This can drive repeat business.  

### 6.2b Closing Example
Trevor went through all the expected steps and purchased a GMC Sierra. The sales person provided him with choices in the trim-level and color he wanted, and followed up to reasure him of what a good purchase it was, even provided coupons for a local car wash. These factors helped Trevor to be satisfied with the purchase.  

## 6.3 How Involvement Level Affects Consumer Decisions
"Distinguish between hig-involvement and low-involvement purchase decisions."  

### Opening Example
Personal selling services for some categories of products can improve both sales and the consumers' experience. Target wants to implement these services for categories where it would have the most impact. Which to choose will depend on the level of involvement required for purchases in each category.  

### 6.32a Learning It: How Involvement Level Affects Consumer Decisions
**Involvement** is measured by how interested a consumer is in an item, and how important it is to them. Expensive items have a higher level involvement, as to highly visible items that impact how the consumer is perceived (clothing, shows, vehicals). These factors can be categorized as _Financial Risk_ and _Social Risk_.

### 6.3b Consumer Decision Making Styles
The level of problem solving required for a purchase (level of involvement) lead to various styles of decision making:

    <table class="zebra fixed">
      <thead>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <th>Decision-Making Style</th>
          <th>Level of Involvement</th>

        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <td class="zebra row-header">Routinized response behavior</td>
          <td class="zebra">Low</td>
          <td class="zebra">Little</td>
          <td class="zebra">Short</td>

        </tr>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <td class="zebra row-header">Limited problem solving</td>
          <td class="zebra">Low to moderate</td>
          <td class="zebra">Little to moderate</td>
          <td class="zebra">Short to medium</td>
          <td class="zebra">Clothing, cookware, personal electronics</td>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="zebra">
          <td class="zebra row-header">Extended problem solving</td>
          <td class="zebra">High</td>
          <td class="zebra">Extensive</td>
          <td class="zebra">Long</td>
          <td class="zebra">Automobile, furnature, college</td>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

&nbsp;  
_Routinized response behavior_ typically involved items that have a low social and financial risk associated with them. It is normal for consumers to have a short list of acceptable items that they use frequently, like mayonaise or tooth paste. Decisions are made quickly with little thought.  

_Limited problem solving behavior_ involve items that are purchased less frequently but still have low social and financial risk. Consumers will perform limited information gathering. This could also include new items in a new or existing category. Examples include: new brand of laundry soap, an oil change, gloves that work with cellphone touch screens.  

_Extended problem solving_ occurs for items with high social and/or financial risk. Consumers may spend significant time gathering information and/or evaluating what they are willing to spend. Examples are: A home, car, educational institution, a European vacation, a new appliance.  

### 6.3c Closing Example
Target focused their personal selling services on areas of their store that likely required consumers to use extended problem solving behavior: Jewelry, electronics, and furniture.  

## 6.4 Social Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
"Describe the five social factors that influence consumer behavior."  

### Opening Example
Marketers recognize the role that external factors play in consumer decision making and are always looking for ways to leverage this. Lilly Pulitzer is a 60-year old lifestyle brand once popularized by Jackie Kennedy. To survive they need to draw in a younger customer base. What social factors can they use to achieve this, and how can they create awareness, sales, and loyalty in these young customers?  

## 6.4a Learning It: Social Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
Five social factors influence consumer purchase decision making:
1. Culture
2. Social Class
3. Reference Groups
4. Family
5. Opinion Leaders

#### Cultural Influences
Culture is the collection of core values, preferences, tastes, and beliefs, typically handed from one generatin to another with little change. Subcultures include unique behaviors and values within a culture. In the U.S. there are many ethnic subgroups that have their own unique preferences as well. Marketing strategies can be improved and targeted by understanding target cultures and their subcultures. Simply put, what works in one country or culture may not work in another. Marketers need to be sensitive to this, and to changes in what is popular in a given group.  

#### Social Class
Class is based on occupation, education level, income, wealth, among other factors. Income and wealth in particular influence how much disposable income (discretionary spending) a household has. This in turn influences where consumers shop and what they decide to purchase.  

#### Reference Groups
Reference groups may be people, organizations, or institutions. They have opinions that are valued and influence an individuals behavior and values. The two strongest factors in how influencial reference groups are to the individual are:
* _The visibility of the product to others:_ High social risk is associated with highly visible products like clothing and cars. Reference groups will have a high level of influence on purchasing decisions of these items.  
* _The purchaser's suceptibility to influence:_ Some people are simply more suseptible to being influenced by their reference groups. Young people often fall into this category.  

#### Opinion Leaders
Opinion leaders are influencers within a refrence group. They tend to share their opinions, which can influence others considering a product. Social media can amplify their influence.  

#### Family
Family is what one is born into and what one forms for themselves. This is a highly influencial factor. Understanding family structure has had to adapt to modern times. Traditinal roles have been replaced with two income households, fathers active in child care, husbands shopping for groceries. Marketers need to understand the different types of families in the modern world.  

### 6.4b Closing Example
Lilly Pulitzer collaborated with Target to create products to appeal to younger customers, who didn't have the discretionary spending needed to purchase from their Lilly stores. They have also courted sororities, and worked with SnapChat to create branded filters.  

## 6.5 Psychological Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
"Describe the five psychological factors that influence consumer behavior."  

### Opening Example
Greg Glassman created CrossFit® to meet consumers desire for health and wellness, and maintaining a youthful appearance. He now has over 15,000 affiliates across the world. What factors move consumeres to choose CrossFit® over the competition?  

### 6.5a Learning It: Psychological Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
Internal attributes that influence consumer decision making include _needs and motives_, _perceptions_, _attitudes_, _learned responses_, and _self-concepts_.  

#### Needs and Motives
Behavior is driven by a perceived _need_ to change the consumers current state to a desired state.

  </div>
</div>

A person's _motives_ are what drive them to satisfy their need. They guide their behavior to achieve the desired state. Marketers attempt to make a need felt, then influence the consumer through their motive to purchase a specific product.   

#### Perception
People's _perception_ of a product is dependant on what they want to perceive, and have a strong influence on their behavior. Marketers use size, shape, color, logos, and other factors to evoke a favorable response from the mind of the consumer.  

#### Attitudes
A consumer's perception of a product is highly influenced by their attitudes. Attitudes are formed through experiences and affiliiations (social contracts) and can be highly resistant to change. Marketers want to influence consumers attitudes towards their brand (or market their brand to appeal to consumer attitudes).  

#### Learning
An initial positive experience with a product can create a repeat customer, as well as generate free word of mouth advertising to attract other customers. Significant resources are dedicated to creating a positive first impression. Free samples can provide this, and introduce consumers to products they might not have tried. Branding, loyalty programs, and bulk discounts can reinforce repeat business.  

#### Self-Concept
A person's view of themselves has four components:

### 6.5b Closing Example
CrossFit® differenciates itself from other gyms by using functinal equiptment and a community approach. Participants perform daily challenges, cheer for eachother, and share share results on social media. They also become part of a community with magazines, blogs, events, and podcasts. This aligns well with the self-concepts of it's members.  

## 6.6 Situational Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior
