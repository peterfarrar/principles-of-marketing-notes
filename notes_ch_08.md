### Learn It Today... Use It Tomorrow
Nederlander Producing Company owns and operates theaters in New York City and London. They understand that a show that works in London may not play well to American audiences, and vice versa. Subtle changes in language can succeed in one country and fail in another. None the less, by proceeding carefully (and sometimes expensively), they have been successful in doing so. Now their interested in expanding into other markets like China and Turkey. By forming a strategic partnership with China Arts and Entertainment Group, the organization hopes to help each other succeed in the others markets.  
To succeed in foreign markets, modern marketers need to answer questions like these:  
* How do our products fit into a foreign market?
* How can we turn potential threats into opportunities?
* Which strategic alternatives will work in global markets?

## 8.1 Global Marketing
"Describe the global business landscape in terms of U.S. exports, and major industries."  

### Opening Example
Imagine if you could only purchase products made in the United States. No iPhone, no Nikes or Adidas. No coffee! Does the location of where products are produced influence your purchasing decisions?

### 8.1a Learning It: Global Marketing
Less than half of the top ten largest public corporations are in the United States. And those that are in the united states are still international marketers, producing and marketing their goods in part or full across the world.

Global trade is divided in to two general categories, **exporting** and **importing**. Global trade expands markets, creates prduction and distribution economies, allows companies growth opportunities in other countries, and makes them less dependent on local economic conditions.  

The maturity of North American markets makes global trade especially important to North American companies. Rapidly growing economies in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Central Europe, and the Middle East provides opportunities for revenue growth.  

#### Exports
In the 1800s, the U.S. mainly export physical goods and agricultural products. Today four out of every five dollars is from services. These include banking, entertainment, business services, technical services.  
Financial services are growing in large part through the internet. Examples include online banking, payment apps like Venmo and Zell, Equity trading platforms like E*Trade and Robinhood.
And the entertainment industry, movies, music videos, television programs, are grossing larger sums in foregn markets than at home.  

#### Imports
Importing goods increases selection while reducing costs. Raw materials can be imported to be processed in the U.S. and products can be produced abroad at a lower price, then imported and marketed domestically.  

### 8.1b Closing Example
Imports create options that can't be achieved through domestic production alone. They also reduce costs. And the food options we gain both in selection and season raises the standard of living for everyone.  

## 8.2 Multinational Economic Integration
"Differenciate between WTO, USMCA, and EU in terms of basic functions and member countries."  

### Opening Example
Selling internationally introduces complexity. Each country has their own set of rules, including taxes, trade restrictions, currency, and possibly tariffs. How to these challenges impact a global marketer? How might they impact a consumer?  

### 8.2a Learning It: Multinational Economic Integration
SInce WWII, there has been increased _multinational economic integration_. It can be organized in a number of ways, with **free-trade areas** being a simple approach. The EU and the USMCA are examples of free-trade areas.  
Not everyone loves free trade. Jobs move out of more developed countries, in to less developed ones that have fewer restrictions, lower taxes, lower wages. This in turn brings down wages for workers in the more developed countries.  
The trade off, free trade produces a wider variety of products, and at lower cost to the consumer.  

#### The World Trade Organization
The WTO is a 164 nation organization that provides the following:  
* Oversees trade agreements among members
* Serves as a forum for trade negotiation
* Mediates trade disputes
* monitors national trade policies
* works to reduce trade barriers

WTO decisions on trade disputes are binding to member countries. Membership takes multiple rounds of negotiations lasting years.  
Although the WTO has major policy initiatives, they move slowly, as members at different levels of development have different needs and concerns. Primarily the WTO provides dispute resolution, as well as technical help and training for developing economies.  

#### The European Union
The best known multinational economic community is the European Union.
* Common currency
* Work to remove trade restrictions
* Free flow of goods and workers between member nations
* Promotes human rights within member countries, and globally

TH E.U. is composed of 27 countries, with six more seeking membership. The E.U. is a huge market of 510 Million people.

#### USMCA
The USMCA replaces and updates NAFTA with higher wages, improved protections for the auto industry in all three nations, environmental protections, tariff protections on digital products, and is expected to increase the GDP of each of the three nations.  

### 8.2b Closing Example
GLobalization impacts every industry in some way. Trade agreements facilitate the exchange of goods, and changes in trade agreements can have significant impact on how companies participate, and on their success.  
The WTO can provide conflict resolution when countries fail to abide by trade agreements.  

## 8.3 The International Marketing Environment
"Summarize the five major factors that influence the global marketing environment."  

### Opening Example
Unilever produces food, beverages, cleaning agents, and personal care products. They have been able to outperform their competitors, Proctor & Gamble and L'Oréal, in emerging markets like Pakistand, Indonesia, and Egypt. Large populations in these countries live in poverty. How was Unilever able to utilize information from its external environment and adjust its global strategy so that it could succeed in these markets?  

### 8.3a Learning It: The International Marketing Environment
International marketers must also pay close attention to changes in their environment.  

#### Internal Economic Environment
Factors that determine what products will be successful in a country include it's size, per-capita income, and stage of economic development. Low per-capita income imply that expensive machinery would not do well there, but that more affordable hand tools might do well. Consumer goods and services produced in the U.S. would typically do better in wealthier countries.  
Inadequate infrastructure in banking, transportation, communications, utilities, and public services, could make manufacture and distribution of products difficult.  
Exchange rates also play a role in marketing strategy. Changes in currency value can impact pricing of goods, and may make it difficult to compete.  

#### International Social-Cultural Environment
Different cultures have different social norms and interact and conduct business in different ways. The French love debate, the Chinese prize humility as a virtue and consider being late an insult, the Swedes do not engage in humor durring negotiations and value consensus.  
Understanding the local language is important for messaging. The story of that the Chevy Nova sold poorly in South America because it translated to "Doesn't go" illustrates this idea, even though it's not true.  

#### International Political-Legal Environment
It is essencial that organizations stay up to date on laws and trade regulations in each country in which they operate. The political environment can include labor conditions and workers' rights, as well as risks from political unrest. Many companies have **political risk assessment** units to evaluate risks where they do business.  

#### International Technological Environment
In particular, the internet has revolutionized the way businesses can participate in the global economy. It has created new marketing and purchasing channels, and reaches almost every part of the planet. Developing nations and small businesses can compete internationally over the internet. Africa has the fastest growing internet population, while Asia, Europe and North America have the largest.  

#### International Competitive Environment
It is important to adapt products and services to the countries in which an organization is operating, because each has its own unique culture and expectations. It is also important to note that through the internet, consumers can now shop internationally.  

### 8.3b Closing Example
Unilever's success was in part by creating novel sales and distribution channels in countries where they wanted to expand. In the Phillipines they gave discounts to large stores in exchange for leveraging them as distributers to smaller independant markets. In India they trained local rural woman to be local sales agents. They also modified products to be smaller and more affordable than in their more industrialized markets. Unilever succeeded where others had failed by examining its external environment and recognizing new opportunities that gave them a competitive edge.  

## 8.4 Strategies for Entering Foreign Markets
"Summarize the six alternative strategies for entering global markets."

### Opening Example
Cioccolato chocolates is a small family owned chocolate company in NYCs Little Italy. Through their website they've been shipping chocolate to 20 different countries. It's time to expand internationally. But how to start? Based on their industry, size, and goals, what global entry strategy should they choose?  

### 8.4a Learning It: Strategies for Entering Foreign Markets
Entering foreign markets offers more than just an opportunity for increased revenue. It also offers insights in to new ways to do business, new ideas for products, and marketing ideas that they may be able to leverage in their domestic market as well. Generally speaking, the more control an organization maintains, the higher the risk.  
There are six strategies for entering foreign markets. Organizations can use more than one at the same time:  
* Exporting
* Franchising
* Foreign Licensing
* Subcontracting
* International divisions
* Acquisitions
* Join ventures

    </div>
</div>

#### Exporting
Exporting allows producers to sell in foreign markets without commiting to formal operations.  
Export trading companies (ETCs) buy products domestically to resell in foreign markets. Producers lose control over the marketing and distribution, but it is a low cost, low risk channel, and provides some feedback regarding their potential marketability abroad. 
Export-management companies (EMCs) provide expert services to connect exporters with foreign buyers, and navigate legal and regulatory barriers. This option provides the producer with a little more control over the process.  

#### Franchising and Foreign Licensing
A **franchise** is a contractual agreement between a franchiser and a franchisee. The franchiser provides the franchisee the right to use their name, sell their products, and also provides marketing, management, and other services. The franchisee agrees to follow the franchisers operating requirements. Franchising typically reduces risks for the franchisee by offering a proven concept, brand recognition, increased operating efficiencies, and reduced costs.  
**Foreign licensing** grants rights to a foreign marketer within a geographical region. The foreign marketer may have access to trademarks, use of patents and patented processes, as well as distribution and marketing rights. These agreements usually exist for a predetermined period of time, before they are renegotiated.  
Franchising and licensing have more risk than exporting, but allow greater control over the marketing and distribution while allowing access to local partners with expertise in distribution channels and legal barriers. The initial cost is limited, making it an appealing option for companies of all sizes.  

#### Subcontracting
Subcontracting the production of goods can help avoid cultural challenges, and protect against import tariffs. It can also reduce manufacturing costs.  
On the down side, it may also result in associating the brand with harsh working conditions, or produce inferior products.  

### 8.4b International Direct investment
#### International Divisions
Larger companies with the resources can establish facilities in their target region and maintain complete control over the operations.  

#### Acquisitions
Another way to enter a foreign market is to purchase an established business there.  

#### Joint Ventures
Joint ventures allow an organization to establish local partnerships and share costs, risks, and management of the operations there.  

### 8.4c Closing Example
Cioccolato chose to keep risk low. They didn't have the resources for a joint venture, or the brand name recogniztion for franchising or licensing, and would prefer to use an ETC or EMC to export their products.  

## 8.5 Marketing Mix Strategies
"Describe five alternative marketing mix strategies use in global marketing."  

### Opening Example
The Oreo is iconic in the United States. Few can say they haven't enjoyed an Oreo in their youth. But in the mid nineties, Kraft's launch of the Oreo in China failed to capture more than 3% of the market. What did they do wrong?  

### 8.5a Learning It: Marketing Mix Strategies
International marketers need to ask two questions to determine which of five strategies to employ:
1. Should they change the product for the international market?
2. Should they change the promotional strategy the international market?

Based on the answers to those questions, they can select one of the following five marketing mix strategies:  
1. Straight extension
2. Promotion adaption
3. Product adaption
4. Dual adaption
5. Product invention

Following straight extension, the product is marketed as is and in the same manor as other markets. This allows for reduced costs, and consistant branding and marketing in all markets.  
For other markets aspects of the product, the marketing campaign, or both, may need to be adapted for the local culture.  
And in some markets, products that wouldn't work in other markets could be invented and marketed along side or in place of existing products.  

### 8.5b Closing Example
Kraft used a straight extension strategy for Oreos in China and it didn't work. Not only do Chinese not eat a lot of cookies, but their pallet is different than the American pallet, and they simply didn't like the taste. They also thought they were too expensive.  
Kraft used a dual adaption strategy, changing the flavor, developing new fillings like green tea, and selling the cookies in smaller, cheaper packages. They also changed their advertising from the American parents introducing their children to dunking the cookies in milk, to Chinese childern introducing their parents to the ritual. Oreos are now the best selling cookie in China.  

## 8.6 Determining a Market Entry Strategy
"Given an example of a company's goals for expanding globally, determine the most appropriate market entry strategy."  

### Opening Example
Nederlander's partnership with the China Arts and Entertainment Group has help it successfully expand into Asia. Now they're looking at the Middle East, and the International Istanbul Theater Festaval. They need to determine the most appropriate strategy.  

### 8.6a Learning It: Determining a Market Entry Strategy
The Nederlanders expect they will use a product adaption strategy to enter the Istanbul market. Because of the language differences, they also recognize the need for local expertise. They are willing to sacrifice some control to form a joint partership with the right organization. This will also mean shared responsibility for managment, and insure cultural fit, while still allowing them a large degree of control over the operation.  
Before chosing an entry strategy, the Nederlanders carefully considered how their goals fit into the new market.
