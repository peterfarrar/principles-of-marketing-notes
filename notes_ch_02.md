Under Armours rapid growth has placed it to compete with industry leader Nike. UA has developed relationships with stakeholders (customers, suppliers, retailers), been reative with it's marketing mix, and uses planning methods across all levels of management, to promote the companies goals.

## 2.1 Marketing Planning: The Basis for Strategy and Tactics
"Contrast how marketing plans differ at various levels in an organization."  

### Opening Example
Uber has grown from a single city black car service to a multi service 800 city, 80 country technology driven company. How are big decisions made? Who makes the strategy decisions and who oversees their execution?  

### 2.1a Learning It: Marketing Planning: The Basis for Stratgy and Tactics
**Planning**: Making decisions for the future based on expectations (assumptions) about future conditions.  
**Marketing Planning**: Planning around marketing goals. This includes product development, pricing, distribution, and promotion.  
**Strategic Planning**: Planning to achive long-term primary objectives. This includes necessary actions and resource allocation. Typically this is the priority of upper leadership.  
**Tactical Planning**: Short term planning of the detailed actions to drive forward the strategy. This is typically the domain of middle management (GMs and directors).  
**Operational Planning**: Managers develop programs to meet the goals in their area.  

#### Planning at Different Managerial Levels
| Management Level | Type of Planning<br />Emphasized at This<br />Level | Examples |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **_Top Management_**<br />Board of Directors<br />&nbsp;<br />Chief Executive Officer<br />&nbsp;<br />Chief Operating Officer<br />&nbsp;<br />Chief Financial Officer<br />&nbsp;<br />Chief Marketing Officer | Strategic planning | Organization-wide<br />objectives<br />&nbsp;<br />Fundamental strategies<br />&nbsp;<br />Long-term plans<br />&nbsp;<br />Total budget |
| **_Middle Management_**<br />General sales manager<br />&nbsp;<br />Team leader<br />&nbsp;<br />Director of marketing<br />research | Tactical planning | Quarterly and semi-<br />annual plans<br />&nbsp;<br />Business unit budgets<br />&nbps;<br />Divisional policies and<br />procedures |
**_Supervisory Management_**<br />Regional sales manager<br />&nbsp;<br />Supervisor-<br />telemarkeing office | Operational planning | Daily and weekly plans<br />&nbsp;<br />Unit budgets<br />&nbsp;<br />Deparmental rules and<br />procedures |

_Strategic planning:_ Top management make long term decisioins.  
_Tactical planning:_ Middle management in charge of areas affected by the strategic plan (possibly all areas) set goals and milestones.  
_Operational planning:_ Supervisory management in affected business areas develop programs and procedures to facilitate/achive goals set by tactical planning.  

### 2.1b Closing Example
_Planning in action:_ COVID-19 upended the Uber business model. Ridership dropped 80% However a less core service, Uber Eats, increased it's business by 53%. Uber pivoted towards this service, purchased their competitor in this space (strategic), Postmates, and even introduced Uber Direct (delivery of consumer goods) and Uber Connect (C2C package delivery) (tactical). This allowed Uber to continue to leverage and persist their driving fleet. They also provided PPE to drivers and introduced new features to the app to allow drivers to cancel to passengers that showed undesirable behaviors, like refusing to wear masks (operational).  

## 2.2 Marketing Plan Components
"Summarize the six components of a marketing plan."  

### Opening Example
Organizations of all sizes make decisions around products, resource allocation, markets, etc. The ability to succeed with these is usually the development and implementation of a good marketing plan.  
In 2008 Catipillar Inc. made a number of stratigic changes around the U.S. truck market. They stopped supplying engines to truck manufacturers and instead partnered with Navistar (International Trucks). How can they determine if this strategy change was sound? What information helps managers decide if they need to adjust their strategy?  

### 2.2a Learning It: Marketing Plan Components
A **marketing plan** is an important part of the strategic planning process. It enables key player to understand where they fit into the organization's strategy, and establishes how to evaluate performance.

[comment]: # (see page 26, exhibit 2.3 "Mon Ami Gabi Marketing Plan Elements")
Marketing plans should be flexable, allowing management to reevaluate and adapt to the reality on the ground including misconceptions and changes in the environment.  

### 2.2b The Marketing Planning Process
The planning process consists of six steps that follow in the same order as the sections of the marketing plan. Define the mission of the organization, determine objectives, assess resourcess, evaluate risks in the environment, evaluate opportunities.  
Marketers use the information from the planning process to develop a marketing strategy, implement with operating plans, monitor the progress and gather feedback neccessary to adapt the strategy.  

### 2.2c Closing Example
Caterpillar used SWOT analysis to identify a variety of changes in the environment. Their strength was in their high quality engines, and their preparedness for upcoming emission regulation changes. However, one of their largest engine customers was developing its own engine, which would undercut profits for Caterpillar. Also, many competitors were behind schedule on the emission regulation change. The decision to partner with Navstar was probably based on their existing relationship with the truck manufacturer. 
As it turned out, Navstar was not a good partner for Caterpillar. Their reputation for quality was below that of Caterpillar and it cut into their profitability. After five years Caterpillar pulled out of the agreement.
Caterpillar made a calculated strategic change based on the SWOT analysis. As it turned out, some aspects of risk were not properly considered. However, Caterpillar did monitor their performance indicators and adjusted their strategy when it was clear to them that the partnership wasn't going to meet their objectives.  

 ## 2.3 Industry Structure and Competition
 "Summarize the competitive Forces of Porter's Five Forces model."  

 ### Opening Example
 Red Bull was the "first" energy drink. Created in Austria in 1987 and introduced to the U.S. in 1997. Competition came in the form of Rockstar Energy Drink in 2001 and Monster Energy Drink in 2002. The energy drink market is over $8B USD.Is their room for more? What would a potential entrant want to consider before trying to launch a new product?  

### 2.3a Learing It: Industry Structure and Competition

#### Porter's Five Forces
| Competitive<br />Force | Force Description | Impact on Industry Profits |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Threat of<br />new<br />competitors** | The degree to which new<br />competitors may easily enter<br />the industry and disrupt<br />established firms. | If the threat is high, established<br />firms may lower prices to fend<br />off competition or make<br />investments to discourage<br />competition. This reduces<br />industry profitability. |
**Supplier<br />power** | The amount of bargaining<br />poser a supplier exerts on its<br />customers and other channel<br />members. | If the industry structure<br />contains suppliers with high<br />levels of power, industry<br />profitability will be reduced<br />since suppliers may charge<br />higher prices or transfer costs<br />to other channel partners. |
**Buyer<br />power** | The amount of bargaining<br />power a customer (either<br />consumer or buisness-to<br />buisness buyer) exerts on its<br />supplier and other channel<br />members. | If the idustry contains buyers<br />who wield power, industry<br />profitability will suffer sinc<br />buyers may demand more<br />services, lower prices, or higher<br />levels of quality. |
| **Threat of<br />substitutes** | A substitute threat occurs when<br />a product or service can be<br />replaced with goods and<br />services from a competing firm<br />or industry | If the threat of substitutes is<br />high, industry profitability will<br />be reduced due to increased<br />competition. |
**Competitiuve<br />rivalry** | The intensity of competition<br />among industry participants,<br />usually a direct result of the<br />four previous forces. | If competitive rivalry is high,<br />profitability will be reduced. |

The _threat of new competitors_: Complexity of product or legal barriers like regulation and zoning can raise the cost of entrance. Businesses with a low cost of entry can have more competition, and so lower profits.  

The _power of suppliers_: Limited suppliers for a given material, or limited supply, can shift power to the suppliers. Exclusive rights, like desirable brands, can also empower suppliers to pass costs onto the next step in the supply chain.  

The _powerful customers_: Large realtors like Walmart can increase profits by increasing distribution, but can also demand better margins.  

The _threat of substitution_: The ability to replace products with another company's impact profitability. Companies need to change pricing structure or inovate new products.  
The _rivalry among competitors_: Competition can lead to price discounts, agressive product development, and pricy advertising, in an attempt to differenciate a company's products from its competitors.  

### 2.3b Closing Example
THe power drink market has a high threat of substitution from traditional markets like coffee and tea. However the market is saturated and margins are low, making the likelyhood of new entrants also low.  
Areas like "natural" and "organic", and regional markets may still have opportuniites for new entrants. Especially if using low cost contract manufacturing.  

## 2.4 SWOT Analysis
"Differentiate the elements of a SWOT analysis."  

### Opening Example
After identifying qualities of itself, it's competitive environment, and other environmental factors and their influence on customers, suppliers, and the industry, Pategonia is using SWOT to help identify viable strategic objectives.  

### 2.4a Learning It: SWOT Analysis
#### Internal factors: Strenght and Weakness  

Strengths are core competencies, and points of differentiation. For Patagonia this can include high quality of items, and CSR (Environmentally sensitive).  

As weaknesses are internal factors, it is within the company power to overcome them. In the case of Patagonia, they recognize that their brand is not seen as fashion forward, and that they have a limited number of outlets, compared to their competition. It is up to them if they want to market their products as fashionable, modify the line to be more fashionable, and whether to open more retail outlets.  

#### External factors: Opportuniites and Threats  
Identifying opportunites could lead to launching new products, entering new markets, or leveraging social or economic factors to market their products.  

Threats like cultural changes in asthetic, government regulation, or negative economic changes can be identified and mitigated. These are typically out of the companies control, but require that the company adapting.  

#### SWOT Analysis
SWOT helps companies shape strategies to maximize the companies value. Sometimes it's about avoiding risks, other times it's about seizing them.  

_Leverage_ is when a company uses an identified strength to take advantage of an external opportunity to create a competitive advantage. Threats,on the other hand, can limit a companies strengths.  

### 2.4b Closing Example
Having identified their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, Patagonia can use them to shape their competitive strategy.  

## 2.5 Portfolio Analysis - A Planning Tool
"Explain how the BCG matrix is used for marketing planning."  

### Opening Example
Consumer behviors around snacking are changing. Consumers are choosing snacks that are healthier, fresher, and less salty. Frito-Lay has a 36.6% market share in the salty snack segment. How can they make decisions about what to kind of snacks to add, change, and phase out, with the future in mind?  

### 2.5a Learning It: Portfolio Analysis - A Planning Tool
Successful companies have a marketing planning process. Larger companies, with diversified offerings, divide their products into _Strategic business units (SBUs)_. Each typically has it's own leadership team developing their own marketing strategy. 

Upper management use _Portfolio Analysis_ to evaluate SBUs. _The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix_ is widely used to determine which SBUs are keepers and which should be phased out or sold off based on two dimensions: _Industry Growth Rate_ and _Relative market Share_.  
```
Relative_Market_Share = Company_Sales / Market_Sales
```

  </div>
</div>

**Stars** have high a market share in high growth markets. They generate lots of income, but also require lots of investment to keep them going.  

**Cash Cows** have a high market share in lower growth markets. They generate cash to fund other SBUs with higher growth potential.  

**Question Marks** have low market share in high growth markets. They usually require more investment than they generate in revenue. They could become a star... or a dog. Decisions have to be made about investiing, or withdrawing.  

**Dogs** have low market share in low growth markets. Often it is best to withdraw. They may have value to other companies and could be sold.  

### 2.5b Closing Example
Frito-Lay can consider it's dominant share in potato chips and tortilla chips a cash cow for now, but should fund expansion in to "healthier" options. The BCG matrix can help to identify question-marks and future stars.  

## 2.6 Using SWOT Analysis and BCG Matrix
"Given an example of a strategic analysis, categorize the findings utilizing the SWOT analysis and BCG matrix."  

### Opening Example
Under Armour's success is in large part due to strategic planning. Two  methods of strategic planning are SWOT analysis and BCG matrix.
